            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

88. 6. Heman</hi> uſeth this word to expreſſe his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe;

               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Proved by 3. reaſons. <hi>The firſt.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe the remedy here preſcribed is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3405:19"/>
                  <hi>faith;</hi> to <hi>ſtay himſelfe</hi> upon God, and that as upon

that is the point he is troubled about, and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which he is in darkneſſe; and that is it, which
faith, which is propounded here as the remedy,
doth in the firſt place and principally looke unto,
as its primary aime, and object.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> in the foregoing verſes he had ſpoken
of <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> whereby God pardons our ſinnes,
and accepts our perſons: The Prophet, or Chriſt
in the perſon of his elect, (as ſome) having expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his aſſurance of this: <hi>God is neare that juſtifies me,
who ſhall condemne?</hi> (Which words the Apoſtle
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32, 33. doth alleadge in the point of <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
and to expreſſe the triumphing aſſurance
of it; and applies them in the name and perſons of
true beleevers) now becauſe there might be ſome
poore ſoules, who though truely <hi>fearing God,</hi> yet
might want this aſſurance; and upon the hearing of
this might be the more troubled, becauſe not able
to expreſſe that confidence which he did: therefore
he addes, <hi>who is among you that feareth the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
as if he ſhould have ſaid, though you want the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
ſenſe and aſſurance of this, be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
but doe you exerciſe faith, goe out of your
ſelves, rely upon Chriſt and that mercy which is to
be found in God: you may feare God and want it;
and you are to truſt in God in the want of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third.</note> theſe words have a relation alſo to the
fourth verſe, where he ſayes, (as that God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him this aſſurance of his owne juſtification, for
his owne particular comfort in the foregoing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſo) that God had alſo given him the <hi>tongue of the

learned to miniſter a word of comfort in ſeaſon, to him
that is weary and heavy laden:</hi> and thereupon in this
verſe, he accordingly ſhewes the bleſſed condition
of ſuch perſons as are <hi>moſt weary</hi> through long wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in darkneſſe; and withall hee diſcovereth to
them, the way of getting out of this darkneſſe, and
recovering comfort againe: And in all the word
of God, there is not a more comfortable and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
word to one in ſuch a condition to bee
found. All which argues, it is ſpoken of inward
darkneſſe, and trouble of ſpirit, and that in point of
applying juſtification, and <hi>God</hi> to be a mans <hi>God.</hi>

63. 17. the Church there complaines, that God

to comfort thee, nor be at all a witneſſe of
Gods favour to aſſure thee. For <hi>our ſpirit,</hi> that is,
our graces, never witneſſe alone; but if Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
joyneth not in teſtimony therewith, it is ſilent:
<hi>The Spirit of God witneſſeth with our ſpirits, Rom.</hi> 8. 16.
Now therefore, when God hath withdrawne his
teſtimony, then the teſtimony of our hearts, and
of our owne graces hath no force in it.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay,<label type="milestone">

                  </label> can a man have the exerciſe of

                  </label> and ſome graces may then be as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
in the heart, as at any other time. He may
feare God as truely,<note place="margin">How grace may be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when not diſcerned.</note> and as much as ever, and yet
this feare have no light in it to diſcover it ſelfe to
him: it may be in the heart, in <hi>eſſe &amp; operari,</hi> when

               <p>The reaſon is,<note place="margin">The reaſon</note> becauſe as the influence of Gods
favour may be really in the heart, when the ſenſe,
ſight, and light of it is withdrawne; (as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,)
ſo the power of grace may in like maner bee
in the heart, when the light and comfort thereof
is wanting. And although it is true, that every
man having the power of reflecting upon his owne
actions, can diſcerne what thoughts are in him,
and what affections; and can tell for the matter of
them, what he thinkes on, and that he is grieved,
&amp;c. But yet ſo, as he may ſtill queſtion whether
thoſe thoughts be acts of true and unfeigned faith;
and whether thoſe affections of ſorow for ſin, &amp;c.
be ſanctified affections, holy, and genuine, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

is, becauſe though the naturall <hi>ſpirit, which is in a
man knowes the things of a man,</hi> as the Apoſtle hath
it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. that is, his owne thoughts, &amp;c. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding

                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 17.</note>
in diſcerning This, the ſpirit of a man is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull,</hi>
and <hi>cannot know it,</hi> without the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
light of the Spirit of God: who as he is the

that we might know the things which are given us of

the exerciſe of it is the ſeed, which they continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſcatter; but light and joy is the crop that is to
be reaped. This ſeed often lies hid long, though

be ſevered from grace; and the comfort of it, from

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> let us further conſider the other

ſoule of one that feares God,<note place="margin">To be in doubt what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him.</note> may bee filled with
doubts, whether God will ever be mercifull to him
yea or no, and not know what God meanes to doe

himſelfe as one that was in hell; <hi>Free among the dead,</hi>
that is, as one admitted into the company of them

may ſtand by (as it were) ſilent, and ſay nothing
to the contrary, but forbeare to contradict Satan
by any loud teſtimony, or ſecret rebuking him, as

               <p>1. To reveale and repreſent God as angry with

and make him ſenſible thereof; not barely
by concealing his love, but by making impreſſions
of his wrath upon his conſcience immediately, and
not by outward croſſes only. Thus <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 17, 18.
God not onely <hi>hid himſelfe and was wroth,</hi> that is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
his wrath by hiding himſelf; <hi>but I ſmote him
and was wroth:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 16. he <hi>contended</hi> and <hi>was wroth,</hi>
that is, <hi>fought againſt him as an enemy,</hi> as <hi>Eſay</hi> 63. 10.
and this with his wrath upon his ſpirit; for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that the <hi>ſpirit</hi> was ready to faile, and the
<hi>ſoule</hi> which he had made; ſo as it was the <hi>ſpirit</hi>
which was the white God ſhot at and wounded, and
that ſo deepe, that it was ready to faile and come
to nothing; which <hi>Solomon</hi> calls by way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>a wounded ſpirit,</hi> which <hi>who can beare?</hi> and
differenceth it from all other afflictions upon the
outward man, which ſtrike the ſpirit but through
the cloathes of the body mediately; for ſayes he,
<hi>The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtaine his infirmity;</hi> that is,
all ſuch outward afflictions wherein it ſuffers, but
by way of ſympathy, and compaſſion; but when
the ſpirit it ſelfe is laid bare and naked, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

and effects of Gods anger, the Holy Ghoſt
may make upon the ſpirit of his childe: for it is a
truth that God is angry and wroth with them when
they ſinne; which anger he may make knowne,
not onely by dumbe ſignes in outward croſſes and
effects; but by an immediate witneſſing, and plain
and expreſſe ſpeaking ſo much to their conſciences,
and making them to feele ſo much, by ſcalding
drops of his hot diſpleaſure let fall thereon: And
as other Fathers ſhew their anger by whipping
the bodies of their children (upon this ground as
ſayes the Apoſtle) becauſe they are the <hi>Fathers of
our fleſh:</hi> Heb. 12. 9. So, for the like reaſon may
God ſhew his anger, and chaſtiſe his children by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
their ſpirits: For he is the <hi>father of our ſpirits</hi>
as he ſpeakes in the ſame place. And likewiſe our
ſpirits, and the very <hi>bones and marrow of them doe lie
open and naked to him, with whom we have to doe, and
his word</hi> and ſpirit being <hi>quick and powerfull, and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
then any two edged ſword,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12, 13.</note> are able <hi>to divide,</hi>
and cut even to <hi>the bones and marrow;</hi> as the ſame
Author ſpeakes. Yet withall, ſo as when he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his wrath thus upon their conſciences; hee
doth not witneſſe, that this is an eternall wrath
which he hath conceived againſt them: for it is
but a temporary diſpleaſure, <hi>It is but for a moment,</hi>
as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeakes; the indignation of a Father; nor is
it a wrath which revenging juſtice hath ſtirred in
him,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> but <hi>Fatherly affection.</hi> And though the Spirit
tells them that God is diſpleaſed, yet never that
they are accurſed; that is a falſe collection made
out of it.<note place="margin">2. By ſhaking over him the threatnings of eternall wrath.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Yet 2. The holy Ghoſt may proceed yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

herein; ſo farre as to bring forth, and ſhew
him, and ſhake over him the rod of his eternall
wrath, eſpecially when hee hath provoked Chriſt
by preſumptuous ſinnes already; and to prevent
his going on frowardly in the way of his heart.
And this, both 1 by preſenting to them, and ſetting
on all thoſe threatnings which doe hypothetically
and conditionally threaten, even to beleevers, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
damnation: ſuch as that which wee finde
Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If yee live after the fleſh, yee</hi> (even you
beleevers) <hi>ſhall die:</hi> for there is a truth in all ſuch
threatnings, ſo conditionally propounded, which
reacheth Gods deareſt children, under a condition,
and with relation to going on in ſinne: to ſtoppe
him and prevent him in which, when he is a going
on frowardly in the way of his heart, the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
may bring home ſuch threatnings to him, with
reſpect to ſuch a courſe as he is entring into, and
accordingly ſtirre up the feare of that damnation
thus threatned, if he ſhould goe on in thoſe ſinnes
he hath begun to commit: But to apply threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of eternall damnation ſimply to his perſon, as
that thou ſhalt dye eternally; This the holy Ghoſt
doth not ſpeake to the heart of a beleever, when
he is a beleever. And againe alſo 2 the holy Ghoſt
may repreſent to him, and minde him of all thoſe
examples of men in whom for their going on in
ſinne,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. ult.</note> 
                  <hi>his ſoule hath had no pleaſure;</hi> and of Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
with them: As how hee ſware againſt many
of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> for their provocations of him, <hi>that
they ſhould never enter into his reſt;</hi> and how he reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<hi>Eſau</hi> for the deſpiſall of his birthright; and all
this with this end, to ſtartle and awaken him; and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3405:27"/>
with this intimation, that for ſuch and ſuch ſinnes,
God might in like maner deale with him. For

                  <p>How Satan and our hearts increaſe this darkneſſe by

and terrors of conſcience in them that feare him:
<hi>Sathan</hi> and their <hi>owne hearts</hi> (unto which hee may
and doth often further alſo leave them) may take
occaſion from theſe diſpenſations of the holy
Ghoſt, (which are all holy righteous and true) to
draw forth falſe and fearefull concluſions againſt
themſelves, and their eſtates; and ſtart amazing
doubts, and feares of their utter want of Grace and
lying under the curſe, and threatnings of eternall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3405:27"/>
wrath at the preſent; yea and further, of eternall
rejection for the future, and that God will never
be mercifull; and ſo lay them lower, and caſt them
into a further darkneſſe and bondage then the holy
Ghoſt was cauſe of or intended: Miſinterpreting
and perverting all theſe his righteous proceedings;
as interpreting, that withdrawing his light and
preſence, and hiding himſelfe, to be a caſting them
off: Thus <hi>Heman, Pſal.</hi> 88. 14. So likewiſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtruing
that temporary wrath, chaſtiſing and
wounding their ſpirits for the preſent, to bee no
other, then the impreſſions and earneſt of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
vengeance: and arguing from their being
<hi>under wrath,</hi> themſelves to be children <hi>of wrath;</hi> and
miſapplying the application of all thoſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of eternall damnation made by the Spirit
but in relation, and under a condition of ſuch and
ſuch courſes for the future, to bee abſolute againſt
their perſons, and to ſpeake their preſent eſtate;
and becauſe ſuch examples of men caſt off are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to them, to ſhew them what advantage
God might take againſt them; they miſtaking,
thinke they reade their owne deſtiny laid before
them in them; and conclude that God will deale
ſo with them: And thus as the Apoſtle ſayes of
ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 11. That <hi>ſinne taking occaſion by the
Commandement,</hi> (he miſunderſtanding the ſcope of
it, when a Phariſee) <hi>it deceived him, and thereby ſlew
him:</hi> and yet <hi>the Commandement is holy, juſt, and good,</hi>
ver. 12. So Satan and our hearts, by occaſion
of theſe dealings of the Spirit (which are righteous
and true, as himſelfe is, who is the Spirit of truth
and leades into truth,) doe <hi>deceive</hi> beleevers, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3405:28"/>
lay them in their apprehenſions <hi>among the ſtaine
whom God remembreth no more,</hi> as <hi>Heman</hi> ſpeakes,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 5.</p>
               <p>And as in theſe,<note place="margin">The like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in Temporaries.</note> ſo in other workes and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
of Gods Spirit, it is ordinary for Satan and
our hearts to practiſe the like deluſions, and falſe
concluſions upon them. To inſtance in thoſe more
common and inferiour workes of the Spirit on the
hearts of men, not as yet ſavingly regenerated:
The Spirit <hi>enlightning</hi> them, together with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of joy, and a taſt of ſweetneſſe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of the Goſpell, and of ſalvation revealed
therein, which under a condition of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and converſion, the Spirit of God doth make
the offer and tender of Knowne unto their hearts.
Thus hee wrought upon the ſtony ground, and in
the <hi>Iewes</hi> by <hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtery: <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 35. which
light, and taſte, and revelation of this conditionall

their hearts to ſeeke it, they often through

And I inſtance in theſe the rather,<note place="margin">A compariſon betweene the worke of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in them, and of darkneſſe in theſe.</note> becauſe theſe

falſe concluſions which are drawne from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and doe therefore exceedingly illuſtrate the

in their ſenſe, from thoſe who are in covenant with
him: as hee drawes neere unto, and viſits their

of compariſion: So it holds in the falſe apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which Satan and our hearts doe make out of

alike. For Gods dealings with thoſe <hi>Temporary belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
being ſo like to thoſe dealings towards ſuch as

too haſtily conclude their acceptance unto life. And
on the contrary, Gods dealings with theſe <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary

tending but to their preſent diſcomfort, through

               <p>So as to conclude, wee muſt warily ſever the
worke of Gods Spirit herein, from that of Satan,
and our owne hearts; not attributing ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

continues to ſhine, either the <hi>light of comfort,</hi> or <hi>of

retaine light in them. And if at any time he
withhold <hi>that light of comfort in his face,</hi> when yet
he continueth an influence of grace: Then ſo farre
doe our hearts preſently returne to their former

               <p>And the reaſon of all this is as evident as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

               <p>1. In generall:<note place="margin">How potent and prevalent <hi>carnall reaſon</hi> is with us,</note>

what <hi>David</hi> ſayes there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 13, 14.) that is,
we ſuffer it to meddle in matters that pertaine to
the Sanctuary, and to debate and conclude of our

that is, hee thought to have comprehended and
reacht Gods minde in thoſe his diſpenſations, by

               </p>
               <p>But more particularly:<note place="margin">and how deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate an enemy unto <hi>faith,</hi> and the reaſon of it.</note> Carnall reaſon is the
moſt deſperate enemy to faith of all other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in man. For until faith be wrought, it is the moſt
ſupreme principle; but then faith depoſeth &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth
it, &amp; afterwards doth often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict it, yea
excludes it, as unſkilful in its matters, from being of
its counſell. And ſo deepe and deſperate is this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
againſt faith, that look what is the moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
worke and buſineſſe of faith (which is to alter
our eſtates before God, and put us into a ſtate of
juſtification and to aſſure us of it) therein, it ſhewes
a more peculiar enmity againſt faith, by oppoſing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3405:33"/>
it in that worke of it more then in any other. This
enmity ſhewes it ſelfe both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> faith is
wrought, and the one illuſtrates the other. For as
before faith was wrought carnall reaſon ſhewes its
oppoſition, by uſing the utmoſt of its ſtrength to
perſwade a man of the goodneſſe of his eſtate
though without faith; thereby to prevent the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of faith and our ſeeking after it at all as not
needfull to change our eſtates or to juſtifie us, and
thus would keepe it wholly out. And therefore in
the <hi>firſt working of faith,</hi> the holy Ghoſt brings
faith in by force of open armes, as a Conquerour
<hi>caſting downe all thoſe ſtrong holds</hi> and <hi>reaſonings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> (as
the word is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4.) which carnall reaſon had
beene long a building and afortifying, and ſo ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
faith a throne upon the mines of them all.
Thus in like maner <hi>after faith</hi> is thus wrought, all
<hi>that</hi> carnall <hi>reaſon</hi> which is left unſubdued, doth out
of a further revenge of ſuch an overthrow, and
with a greater degree of enmity oppoſe faith ſtill,
onely it diverts the warre, now muſtering up new
forces, and turneth all the great Ordnance a clean
contrary way, namely to perſwade a man by all the
objections it can raiſe, of the badneſſe of his eſtate
now, as before of the goodneſſe of it: Hereby to
blaſpheme the great worke of faith in juſtifying of
us: And alſo, becauſe that next to <hi>juſtifying us,</hi>
the office and errand of faith is to ſettle in our
hearts <hi>peace with God,</hi> and a perſwaſion of our being
in his favour, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. Therefore doth carnall
reaſon bend the utmoſt of its power and <hi>Acumen</hi>
to perſwade upon all occaſions, by all the moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and ſeeming arguments it can ſtart and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3405:33"/>
that God is not at peace with us, nor as yet
reconciled to us; meerely to contradict faith in
what is the principle point it would perſwade us
of.</p>
               <p>So that as in men whileſt unregenerate, carnall
reaſon endeavours by falſe reaſonings to preſerve
a good opinion of their eſtates in them: In like
maner the very ſame principle of carnall reaſon
continuing its oppoſition to faith, doth as much
perſwade to a bad opinion of their eſtates when
they are once regenerated.</p>
               <p>And to conclude this,<note place="margin">The great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage carnall reaſon hath in time of deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> if in any condition that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
Gods childe, <hi>carnall reaſon</hi> hath the advantage
and upper ground of <hi>faith.</hi> It is now when it is in
the <hi>valley of the ſhadow of death,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes,
when <hi>it walkes in darkneſſe</hi> and <hi>hath no light:</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that doth afford a moſt compleat Topick
for <hi>carnall reaſon</hi> to frame objections out of; When
in reſpect of Gods dealings with him there is a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
conjunction of all bad aſpects threatning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and deſtruction: When faith is under ſo
great an eclipſe, and is left to fight it our alone in
darkneſſe, and hath no ſecond: When on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<hi>carnall reaſon,</hi> and our darke hearts (which are
led by ſenſe) are poſſeſſed with the ſenſe (the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt

(that which the heart is moſt jealous of) Gods ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
wrath and diſpleaſure, and that felt and argued
(not mediately and afar off, by conſequence from
outward afflictions, but) immediately from Gods
owne hand. Thou alwayes haſt ſuſpected (ſayes
carnall reaſon) that thou wert a childe of wrath,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3405:34"/>
and that thou and God were enemies; But now
thou findeſt it put out of queſtion, and that from
Gods owne mouth, <hi>who ſpeaketh</hi> grievous things
<hi>againſt</hi> thee;<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 20.</note> thou haſt it alſo under his own hand,
for loe <hi>he writeth bitter things againſt thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job. 13. 26.</note> that is,
in thy conſcience as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks, &amp; <hi>holdeth thee for an
enemy,</hi> ver. 24. and whips thee with the ſame rod of
his immediate wrath and diſpleaſure, where with
hee laſheth thoſe <hi>that</hi> are cut from his hand, and
whom hee remembreth no more, but are now in
hell, as <hi>Heman</hi> ſpeakes. A time alſo this is when
this preſent ſenſe of wrath ſo diſtempers and (to
uſe <hi>Hemans</hi> words) <hi>diſtracts</hi> the minde, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
liſten to faith, which ſpeakes of nothing too,
but of what it fees not; even as the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
<hi>could not attend</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> his meſſage of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
through the <hi>anguiſh</hi> of their preſent bondage
<hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 9. So as no wonder if then carnall reaſon
be moſt buſie, and takes this advantage to frame
and ſuggeſt the ſtrongeſt objections to the ſoule
whileſt it is in this diſtemper.</p>
               <p>Adde unto all this 4. that as there is ſuch ſtrength
of corrupt reaſon which is thus oppoſite to faith,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> ſo
that there are many other principles of corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in the heart,<note place="margin">§ 4. Principle, corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>jealouſie, ſuſpition,</hi> and <hi>incredulity,</hi> joyn with carnall reaſon in this.</note> which joyne and take part
with carnall reaſon in all this its oppoſition againſt
faith, and which ſet it a worke and doe backe it as
much in perſwading Gods children that their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
are naught, as in ſecuring men unregenerate
that their eſtates are good; and the hand of ſelfe-love
(which bribeth and byaſſeth carnall reaſon,
eſpecially in judging of our eſtates) is found as
deepe in the one as in the other; and this doth yet
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3405:34"/>
give further light to this point in hand. For looke
as before faith is wrought, <hi>ſelfe-flattery</hi> (which is
one branch of ſelfe-love) bribeth and ſetteth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
reaſon aworke to plead the goodneſſe of their
eſtates to men unregenerate, and cauſeth all ſuch
falſe reaſons to take with them which tend to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
them to think well of themſelves. So when
once faith is wrought, <hi>jealouſie,</hi> and <hi>ſuſpiciouſneſſe,</hi>
and <hi>incredulity,</hi> (which are other, as great ſprigs of
pride and ſelfe-love in us, as the former, which do
begin to ſprout and ſhew themſelves, when that
other is lopt off, and which doe grow up together
with the worke of faith) theſe doe edge and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the wit of carnall reaſon, to argue and wrangle

               <p>And the reaſon why ſuch <hi>jealouſies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The uſe of them and their working in the heart.</note> and <hi>ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

in the heart upon the worke of faith, and be apt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to prevaile now after faith, is; <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Becauſe that
in the worke of humiliation, (which prepares for
faith) all thoſe ſtrong holds of carnall reaſon being
demoliſht, which upheld ſelfe-flattery, and that
falſe good opinion of a mans eſtate, and thoſe
mountainous thoughts of preſumption as then laid
low, a man is for ever put out of conceit with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as of himſelf. At which time alſo, <hi rend="sup">2</hi> he was ſo
throughly and feelingly convinced of the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3405:35"/>
of ſinne, (which before hee ſlighted) and of
the greatneſſe and multitudes of his ſinnes, that he
is apt now (inſtead of preſuming as before) to bee
jealous of God, leſt he might have been ſo provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
as never to pardon him, and is accordingly apt
to draw a miſinterpretation of all Gods dealings
with him to ſtrengthen that conceit. And <hi rend="sup">3</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
through the ſame conviction the infinite er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and deceitfulneſſe of his heart before, in flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
him and judging his eſtate good, when it
was moſt accurſed, ſo clearely diſcovered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
he thereby becomes exceeding jealous,
and afraid of erring on that hand ſtill, and ſo is apt
to lend an eare to any doubt or ſcruple that is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted.
Eſpecially <hi rend="sup">4</hi> he being withall made appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
both of <hi>that</hi> infinite danger to his eternall
ſalvation there may be in nouriſhing a falſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the goodneſſe of his eſtate if it ſhould prove
otherwiſe; becauſe ſuch a falſe conceit keepes a
man from ſaving faith; whereas to cheriſh the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
errour in judging his eſtate bad, when it is in
truth good, tends but to his preſent diſcomfort;
ſo as he thinkes it ſafer to erre on <hi>that</hi> hand then
the other. And <hi rend="sup">5</hi> being alſo ſenſible of what tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
concernment his eternall ſalvation is of,
(which he before ſlighted) this rowſeth ſuſpition,
(which in all matters of great conſequence and
moment, is alwayes doubting and inquiſitive,)
and alſo keepes it waking, which before lay aſleepe.
And all theſe being now ſtartled and ſtirred up,
doe not onely provoke carnall reaſon unſatisfiedly
to pry into all things that may ſeem to argue Gods
disfavour, or the unſoundneſſe of our hearts, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3405:35"/>
alſo doe give entertainment too, and applaud all
ſuch objections as are found out, and makes up too
haſtily falſe concluſions from them.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> as there are theſe corrupt principles
of carnall reaſon,<note place="margin">3. Principle. <hi>The guilt in our owne conſciences,</hi> remaining in part defiled, a cauſe of this darkneſſe.</note> and ſuſpitiouſneſſe in us, to raiſe
and foment theſe doubts, and feares from Gods
dealings towards us: So there is an abundance of
guilt within us, of our falſe dealings towards him.
And wee have <hi>conſciences,</hi> which remaine in part
<hi>defiled,</hi> which may further joyne with all theſe,
and encreaſe our feares and doubtings; and as wee
are <hi>darke</hi> and <hi>weake</hi> creatures, ſo <hi>guilty</hi> creatures
alſo. And this guilt, like the waves of the Sea, or the
ſwellings of Jordan, doe begin upon theſe terrible
ſtormes from God to riſe, and ſwell, and over-flow
in our conſciences. As in <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 38. when
Gods wrath was ſore upon him, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
he complaines, <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my
head,</hi> ver. 4. There is much guile and falſeneſſe of
heart, which in thoſe diſtempers (when our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
doe boile within us, and are ſtirred and
heated to the bottome) doth like the ſcumme,
come up and flote aloft. Thus in <hi>David</hi> when hee
was under the rod for his ſinne of murther, as the
guilt of his ſinne ſo the <hi>guile</hi> of <hi>his Spirit</hi> came up,
and he calls for <hi>Truth in the inward parts,</hi> Pſal. 51. 6.
For as <hi>his ſinne,</hi> ver. 2. ſo his falſeneſſe of heart <hi>was
ever before him,</hi> and with an eye to this hee ſpake
that ſpeech, Pſal. 32. Oh <hi>bleſſed is that man in whoſe
ſpirit is no guile,</hi> and <hi>to whom the Lord imputeth no ſin.</hi>
Thus hee ſpake when God had charged upon him
the guilt of his ſin, and diſcovered to him the guile
of his ſpirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 5. And this guile doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3405:36"/>
ſo appeare, that our conſciences can hardly
diſcerne any thing elſe to be in us, it lies upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
and covers our graces from our view; and
like as the chaffe when the wheat is toſſed in the
fanne, comes up to the top: So in theſe commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and winnowings of ſpirit, doe our corruptions
float in our conſciences, whileſt the graces that
are in us lyecovered under them out of ſight; and
the darke ſide of our hearts (as of the cloud) is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
towards us, and the light ſide from us. And
indeed there are in the beſt of us humours enough,
which if they bee ſtirred and congregated in our
conſciences, may alone caſt us into theſe burning
fits of trouble and diſtreſſe; ſo as whilſt Gods Spirit
ſhall withhold from us the light of our own graces,
&amp; our own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences repreſent to us the guilt and
corruptions that are in our beſt performances, our
hearts may conclude our ſelves hypocrites, as M.
<hi>Bradfar</hi> in ſome of his letters cloth of himſelf; &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Saints have done. Yea, ſo as even <hi>our own
conſciences,</hi> (which are the onely principle now left
in us, which ſhould take part with and encourage
<hi>faith,</hi> and witneſſe to us (as the office of it is) the
goodneſſe of our eſtates) in this may joyn with the
former corruptions againſt us, and bring in a falſe
evidence, and pronounce a falſe judgement. Even
Conſcience it ſelfe, which is ordained as the urine
of the body to ſhew the eſtate of the whole; (and
therefore is accordingly called <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evill</hi> as the
mans ſtate is) This is apt in ſuch diſtempers to
change and turne colour; and looke to a mans own
view as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3405:36"/>
experience of it. Even becauſe <hi>conſcience</hi> remaines
in part <hi>defiled</hi> in a man that is regenerate: and
though <hi>we are ſprinkled from an evill conſcience</hi> in
part, yet not wholly: ſo as though <hi>our perſons</hi> are
fully diſcharged from the guilt of our ſins, <hi>through
the ſprinkling of Chriſts blood,</hi> before God; yet the
ſprinkling of that blood upon our conſciences
whereby we apprehend this, is imperfect, and the
reaſon is, becauſe this very ſprinkling of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
whereby it reſtifies the ſprinkling of Chriſts
blood, and our juſtification thereby, is but part of
the ſanctification of Conſcience, as it is a faculty,

herein. And hence it is that when Gods Spirit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth
to witneſſe with conſcience, the goodneſſe
of our eſtates, and ceaſeth to embolden and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
conſcience by his preſence, and the ſprinkling
of Chriſts blood upon it againſt the remaining de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement;
that then our conſciences are as apt to
fall into feares, and doubts, and ſelf-condemnings;
even as much as when he withdrawes the aſſiſtance

the Saints with this ſort of temptations, of doubts

as all other his temptations unto ſinne, are but as
the laying in and barrelling up the gun-powder,
and making of the train for this great plot of blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Satan hoped by that groſſe ſinne to have drawne
him into deſpaire. Wee may likewiſe obſerve how
hee did place this temptation in the forefront of
thoſe three aſſaults which hee made upon Chriſt;
who as in his obedience, ſo in his temptations is
made a compleate example unto us; for hee was

to vaine hopes, when hee ſhewed him the glory of

diſtruſts between him and his Father, and between
his humane nature and the divine; For when Chriſt
had newly received that teſtimony from all the

his <hi>Sonne</hi> from heaven; the <hi>Spirit</hi> deſcending on
him at his baptiſme, (it being the ſpeciall grace and
inſtitution of that ordinance to ſeale up adoption

him to queſtion that voice, [that it might be but a

done any outward miracle as yet, as appeares <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.

was the Sonne of God or no, and hypoſtatically

not doe for him, then to queſtion his Son-ſhip; and
thinke all this to bee but a deluſion. This was the

theſe ſtones to be made bread, &amp;c.</hi> withall inſinuating
that God leaving him even deſtitute of daily bread

we heare <hi>Iob</hi> (although never brought to queſtion

<hi>Satan</hi> hath will of himſelfe, and a deſire to it, and
power <hi>phyſicall</hi> enough, and abilities to inflict this

gives to Satan power over the ſonnes and

and as their bodies to be vexed by him, ſo their
ſpirits: and as to provoke them unto ſinne, ſo
much more to terrifie for ſinne: there being more

<hi>David</hi> to Satan, to provoke him unto ſinne, aſwell

permiſſive power only. Which is either 1. obtained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and given at Satans motion &amp; requeſt firſt made;
ſo that phraſe, Luke 22. 31. <hi>Satan hath requeſted and

<hi>Thou movedſt me againſt him;</hi> doth imply: and

So alſo <hi>Iob</hi> was ſingled out for this duel; both by

the ordinance of Excommunication and cenſures

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3405:40"/>
to repentance: Even as on the contrary, the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
worke of baptiſme (which admits into the
Church) to ſuch as were <hi>fideles adulti,</hi> and beleevers
already, was by joy in the holy Ghoſt to ſeale up
their adoption and regeneration unto them: as to
the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 39. This we may ſee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
of the inceſtuous Corinthian;
whoſe excommunication is therefore expreſſed, to
be <hi>a delivering him up unto Satan in the name of the
Lord Ieſus:</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 9. (that is) he was to be caſt out
by a commiſſion from Chriſt, which going forth in
his name; when they publiſhed it on earth, he ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in heaven. Upon which rightly adminiſtred
doth enſue, firſt, that as the Church doth cut them
off from communion with them; ſo God cuts them
off from communion with himſelf, and hides, and
withdrawes the light of his countenance, the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his Spirit, &amp; his comfortable preſence; and
not only ſo, but <hi>delivereth them up to ſatan;</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the conſequent of it: which therefore, becauſe
it implies the former, is put to expreſſe the whole
proceeding; which delivery of him unto Satan, was
not a giving him a commiſſion to cary him on to
more ſin: for the end propounded by the Apoſtle
was to <hi>deſtroy the fleſh,</hi> that is, corruption &amp; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of ſinne, and that <hi>the ſpirit might be ſaved,</hi> ver. 5.
that is, <hi>that</hi> contrary principle of grace which yet
<hi>remained,</hi> but <hi>was ready to die,</hi> (as it is <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2.) might
bee ſaved and kept from death and deſtruction;
(though that often be indeed the effect of it in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
as in <hi>Alexander, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 19.) but it was to
terrifie and afflict his conſcience, and to ſtir up in
him the guilt of his ſin with terrors for it; which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3405:40"/>
God ſanctifieth to humble and to mortifie the fleſh.
And thus, when that Corinthian was excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
did Satan accordingly deale with him; for in
the next Epiſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. we finde him <hi>well nigh
ſwallowed up of ſorow;</hi> which was Satans doing, for
<hi>ver. 11. We are not ignorant</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
partly to this) <hi>of his devices.</hi> And thus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
continued ſtill to handle him, even now when
he began to be truly humbled, and was a fit ſubject
to receive forgiveneſſe and comfort, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. when
though hee feared God and obeyed him, yet hee
walked in darkneſſe, till the Church received
him. Or elſe 3. when this ordinance is not in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
caſe of ſuch ſins adminiſtred, then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
(who workes without an ordinance ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the ſame effects that with it) doth excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
mens ſpirits from his preſence; and gives
them up to Satan, by terrors to whip them home
to himſelfe. So that God gives him leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
power over both godly men and wicked
men, onely with this difference: Wicked men God
gives up unto him, as unto their <hi>Ruler,</hi> and their
<hi>head;</hi> they are therefore called the <hi>rulers of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of this world,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 12. Who therefore <hi>work
effectually in the children of diſobedience:</hi> Epheſ.
2. 2. Or elſe as captives to a <hi>Prince,</hi> he taking them
<hi>captive at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26. ſo as they are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tived
and <hi>led away,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 2. But his owne, God
gives up to him, but as priſoners to a <hi>Iaylor,</hi> as a
Magiſtrate may doe his childe, to commit him;
who hath not a power over his priſoner to doe any
thing with him; but only by appointment, for a
time, with a limited commiſſion, and therefore
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3405:41"/>
cannot put him on the racke, or into the dungeon,
but when and how farre God pleaſeth: even as
when Satan is ſaid to have <hi>caſt them into priſon,</hi>
Rev. 2. 10. his commiſſion was but <hi>for ten dayes,</hi>
and then God rebukes him.</p>
                  <p>Satan having thus obtained leave;<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> now 3. to ſhew
how able and powerfull hee is to worke dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in us,<note place="margin">How able Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is to tempt us.</note> I need not much inſiſt on. His phyſicall
and naturall power to worke upon our ſpirits, by
his creation as he is angell, is exceeding great.
We are a middle ſort of creatures betweene them
and beaſts; beaſts being meerely corporeall, they
meerely ſpirituall, man betweene both; <hi>He made us
a little inferiour to the Angels,</hi> Heb. 2. though but a

we are expoſed to their working and crafty
wyles. The great advantage they have hereby o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>but ſpirituall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſes;</hi>

ſo <hi>Powers</hi> for their naturall abilities; and that
to worke upon us: For it is ſpoken in that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
All which power, how great ſoever in him
at his firſt creation, is now become the <hi>power of
darkneſſe;</hi> and ſo called, becauſe moſt powerfull that
way, namely, to cauſe and worke darkneſſe in us:
and though he can for a need <hi>transform himſelf into
an angell of light,</hi> by deluding his deceived enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſts
with falſe joyes; yet therein hee doth but act a

part, it is but forced; but to ſhew himſelfe an <hi>angell
of darkneſſe,</hi> by terrifying and affrighting weake

lyes moſt in this. Therefore his title further, is the

therefore to ſtand upon our guard, and to looke

                  <p>Onely in the fourth place,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> though Satan hath
never ſo much power,<note place="margin">That the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this his power is much from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in us.</note> yet the advantage and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of this his power to work thoſe diſquietments
in us, is by reaſon of that ſinfull darkneſſe which is
in us. Wee may ſay, that as, unleſſe he had power
<hi>from above,</hi> that is, from God; ſo nor unleſſe he had
furtherance from beneath, even from thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

hee could not diſquiet us. <hi>Satan commeth</hi> (ſaith

and therefore came; but hee had nothing of his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
or of the guilt of any of his workes, to work
upon in Chriſt; &amp; therfore could effect nothing at
all upon his ſpirit. <hi>That</hi> therefore which gives him
priviledge, ſcope, and matter to work thus upon us,
is ſomthing within us; there being even in the beſt
ſomething which doth belong to his juriſdiction,
which maketh their ſpirits fit ſubjects for his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations

which were repreſented to the eye; what elſe
was the reaſon why hee tooke the advantage of a

devil then appeared in a viſible ſhape and ſo te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted
him, for he would have had him fallen downe to

<hi>Avoide Satan,</hi> Mat. 4. 10. as loathing the neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

neer and inward acceſſe to our ſpirits, but for that
darkneſſe in us; by reaſon of which he thus comes
within us; and as darkneſſe mingleth with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſo he with our ſpirits: So that as the light

to get within us;<note place="margin">Of fit matter to work upon.</note> ſo this darkneſſe in us is alſo as fit
fuell, and as tinder to his fiery temptations, that
preſently enkindleth and enflameth: ſo as all thoſe
effects of the principles of darkneſſe mentioned, he
can both increaſe and augment; and ſo addes <hi>black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
to that <hi>darkneſſe</hi> in us, and darkneſſe being his
dominion, therefore ſo much darkneſſe as is in us,
ſo great a party he hath in us to work upon. Hence
therefore all the effects that he worketh in unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate

controverſies hee hath had to deale in but in
particular ages, as occaſionally they were ſtarted;
but this hath beene the ſtanding controverſie of
all ages, ſince God hath had any children on earth;
With every one of whom more or leſſe, he hath at
one time or another had ſolemne diſputes about
it: ſo as he knowes all the advantages, windings,
and turnings in this debate; all the objections, and
anſwers, and diſcuſſions in it. And as other contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies;
the longer they are on foote, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have bin caryed along, the more they are
enlarged, improved and grow more ſubtle: So muſt
this needs alſo, eſpecially in this latter knowing
age of the world; and by reaſon alſo of that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neere ſimilitude which hypocriſie holds unto
the truth and power of grace, (which hath fazled

and difficulties which a beleever meets with in bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out a right judgement of his eſtate,<note place="margin">which of all controverſies is the moſt ſubtill and intricate.</note> are greater
then in any controverſie the world ever knew; and
afford ſtranger knots, and require as acute diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

And indeed ſuch, as, did not the holy Ghoſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cut, ſometimes untie them for beleevers, by
witneſſing with our ſpirits that wee are the ſons of
God, bare reaſon alone could never determine in

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3405:44"/>
hath all theſe at his fingers ends; and hath

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> as he hath thus throughly ſtudied this
controverſie,<note place="margin">Satan knowes how beſt to ſuit his falſe reaſonings to all ſorts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</note> and knowes all the windings and

men, and their ſeverall frames and temper of ſpirit,
as well as of temptations; he knowes all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>rankes</hi> and <hi>claſſes</hi> of men in the ſtate of grace;
and according to their rankes, with what ſort of
temptations to encounter them. For mens
<hi>temptations are various and manifold,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 6. even
as the <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>operations of the Spirit are,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.
4, 5. Now he having beaten out this controverſie
with all ſorts, knowes how to lay the diſpute, how
to order, and marſhall, and apply objections, and
weild his blowes with moſt ſucceſſe and advantage.
That as Phyſitians, having obſerved the ſeverall
workings of medicines of all ſorts, upon ſeverall
ages, &amp; conſtitutions; &amp; what ſeverall iſſues and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
they have had, doe therefore accordingly
preſcribe and apply ſeverall medicines, according
to the ſeverall and differing conditions of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
though ſicke of the ſame diſeaſe: Thus <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:3405:45"/>
he by obſervation finding the <hi>hearts</hi> of ſome

remembring what reaſonings have alwayes taken
moſt with ſuch a ſort or ſtrain of Chriſtians, whoſe
corruptions and whoſe graces were much alike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thoſe in this or that man hee hath now to deale
with; accordingly he makes uſe and application of
theſe reaſonings againe.<note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men are exceeding vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo are capable of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſorts of temptations.</note> 
                  <hi rend="sup">1</hi> The temper of mens

that will moſt take with their ſpirits. And
againe <hi rend="sup">2</hi> the operations of graces, as of ſinne, are
various in thoſe ſeverall tempers. And <hi rend="sup">3</hi> Gods
dealings with, and workings upon his children are
as various as either: ſome he humbleth much, ſome
are led on with comfort; ſome he workes on with a
ſudden and marvellous light, as if the Sun ſhould
riſe on the ſudden, at midnight; and on others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
and by degrees, as when the dawning ſteals
upon the day; ſome have had a falſe &amp; a counterfeit
work before; ſome were never enlightned untill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly;
and this variety affords riſe, &amp; occaſion for
ſeverall temptations. So as what kinde of work any
other Chriſtian hath had, is apt to be made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to another that wants it. I was never thus
humbled ſayes one, nor I thus comforted ſayes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
I had a ſudden violent worke indeed, which
came in like a ſpring tide, but now the tide is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
and my firſt love abated, ſayes a third; I had
ſome workings and enlightnings heretofore ſayes
another, and I was deceived then, and I may be ſo
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3405:45"/>
now alſo; and ſo he hath that vaſt tuſke ſet him, to
compare a counterfeit work with a true. Thus eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeverall way of working lyes open to ſeverall
exceptions; and as we ſay, that every calling earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hath its ſeverall and proper temptations: to the
ſeverall wayes and maner of effecting this calling
heavenly, have their ſeverall veines and currents of
temptations. All which <hi>Satan</hi> knowes, and hath
often traced; and accordingly knowes how to ſit
them to men, and to proſecute them the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
way. So in like maner hee takes the
compaſſe of every mans knowledge, notions, and
apprehenſions; according unto which, as our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is more or leſſe, we are alſo capable of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
temptations. Many reaſonings and objections,
which like ſmall haile-ſhot could not reach, or
make any dint at all upon men of parts and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that ſoare high out of the gun-ſhot of them;
and who have on the <hi>whole armour</hi> of God, as the
Apoſtle ſpeakes <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. are in compleat armour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in all faith and knowledge; yet are fitteſt
to levell with, at ſuch as are more ignorant, and fly
low, and have but ſome few broken pieces of that
armour to defend ſome parts with: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thoſe other of his great ſhot, which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth
on men of knowledge, they would bee
ſhot, and cleane fly over the others heads, and not
come neer ſuch ſmaller veſſels. All in <hi>Thyatira knew
not Satans depths,</hi> nor were capable of them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.
24. Thus ignorance, and want of knowledge of the
meaning of the Scriptures, and of the wayes of
grace chalked forth therein, how doth Satan abuſe,
to the diſquietment of many poore and good
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3405:46"/>
ſoules that want much knowledge, by putting falſe
gloſſes on them? how many weake ſoules do ſtick

with groſſe miſtakes? and like ſmall birds,
are held long under with limed ſtrawes of frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
objections, which great ones fly away with.
S. <hi>Paul</hi> being a man of knowledge was not eaſily

                  <hi>We are not ignorant of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi>

So as <hi>Satan</hi> cannot onely make thoſe falſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which our owne hearts forge more ſpecious,
and probable, and ſuggeſt further confirmations of
them, which are enough to add unto this darknes;

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">To ſuggeſt them in ſuch a maner, as to take and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us.</note> he is not ſimply able to ſuggeſt them,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
but to inſinuate them in ſuch a maner, as to take
with us, and deceive us; yea, and often to ſet them
on with a deep impreſſion. Therefore in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
forementioned, it is not ſimply ſaid, that there
ſhould be ſpirits which ſhould ſuggeſt errors; but
ſo ſuggeſt them, as that <hi>men ſhould give heed unto
them:</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 1. and 2 Theſſ. 2. (where the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

it is not onely ſaid, that they were ſent as from <hi>God</hi>
to <hi>delude,</hi> but with <hi>ſtrong deluſions;</hi> ſuch, as ſhould
have a ſtrength put into them, to prevaile, ſo as that
men ſhould <hi>beleeve</hi> them. So alſo, that <hi>lying ſpirit</hi>
which God ſent, and who perſwaded <hi>Ahab</hi> by a

ſo as it ſhould prevaile with <hi>Ahab;</hi> ſo 2 <hi>Chron. 18. 21.
And the Lord ſaid, thou ſhalt entiſe him, and thou ſhalt

gives leave) to delude wicked mens underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with falſe reaſonings in matters of hereſie and
falſe doctrine, by reaſon of that <hi>totall darkneſſe</hi> that
is in them: So <hi>he</hi> is able (if God give leave (as
ſometimes he doth) to bring ſtrong deluſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the mindes of Gods children alſo, through falſe
reaſonings about their owne eſtates, by reaſon of
that <hi>darkneſſe</hi> which <hi>in part</hi> remaines in them: by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3405:48"/>
meanes of which <hi>he</hi> may work the ſame effects for
a time, and in a certaine degree in a godly man,
which in another, as was before obſerved. Thus
the beleeving <hi>Galatians,</hi> eſpecially ſome of them,
were ſo farre <hi>bewitched</hi> (as his word is) as for a time
to aſſent to that great errour in point of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And this by reaſon of that <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>darkneſſe</hi>
which remained in them, as he intimates, when he
ſayes; <hi>Oh ye [fooliſh] Galatians, who hath [bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched]
you, that ye ſhould not obey the truth:</hi> Gal. 3. 1.
And if in the very doctrine of Juſtification it ſelfe,
beleevers were thus for a time deluded, (which is
rare) then much more may they, and ordinarily are
they miſled in the application of faith, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving

the point in hand.<note place="margin">A caution.</note> Onely this is to be added here

farre in aſcribing unto Satan herein, when it ſayes

and ſo to maintaine and manage and cary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the diſpute, and to come up with freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies:
which in this reſpect is called <hi>wreſtling;</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:3405:49"/>
Epheſ. 6. 12. <hi>We wreſtle not with fleſh and blood, but
principalities and powers,</hi> it being (as the bodily
wreſtling) tranſacted by reiterated aſſaults, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to overcome and get the victory; hee as it
were going about to ſtrike up our heeles, as wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
doe: that is, to take away from under us thoſe
reaſonings which ſupported us, by cavillling obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
which kinde of ſpirituall wreſtlings how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
have we experience of in ſpirituall agonies? In
the houre of temptation beleevers finde conflicts
and bandyings of diſputes, rationally caried along,
and pertinent objections brought in againſt thoſe
anſwers, which they ſecretly meditate of: In which
caſe therefore Divines bid men not to <hi>diſpute</hi> with
that cunning ſophiſter. Thus many when death
hath approached have found that they have had
their reaſonings for their eſtates, and thoſe evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
they have had recourſe unto, taken away &amp;
confuted as faſt as they have thought of them.
And that Satan hath this dexterity and ſkill thus to
manage ſuch kinde of diſputes with us, is further
evident, in the framing of hereſies, wherein he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
the contrivers of them with pertinent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
to backe and confirme their notions, in
their private meditations, ſtudies, and contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And indeed if Satan were not able and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thus to oppoſe and reply, theſe kind of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which conſiſt in diſputes could not be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
for otherwiſe, Satan in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did diſpute with us,
but as if one of us ſhould reaſon with a dumb man
that can heare, but his anſwers cannot be known, &amp;
ſo we know no way what reply to make. Therfore
ſurely Satan hath ſome way, more or leſſe a gueſſe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3405:49"/>
and inkling, often what may be the anſwers of the
heart againe: which were it otherwiſe, the glory
alſo which God hath by the victory gotten over
Satan in theſe temptations, were much obſcured,
and Satans confuſion leſſe; for the victory of our
faith in theſe diſputes, and the reſiſtance it makes,
lyes chiefly in thoſe replies which are made, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it quencheth all his darts: whereof the devill,
when he is once ſenſible, and perceives it, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded;
for then, when he is once ſenſible and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
that he is reſiſted, doth he <hi>fly from us,</hi> as
the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 7. and that of his
owne accord, as the expreſſion there imports; even
as a foiled and diſgraced ſouldier. And this we may
ſee in his cariage in thoſe his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations of Chriſt;
which were managed by mutuall diſputes; and the
foiling of ſatan, was by the anſwers out of Scripture
which Chriſt gave,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 11.</note> by which being confounded, <hi>he
left him</hi> (as the text ſayes) as out of pride, aſhamed
that he was foiled. So that Satan ſome way or other
is able to gueſſe at, and diſcernes the replies in our
hearts to his objections; as well as to make and caſt
in objections.</p>

               <argument>

will now further conſider what power and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he may exerciſe upon that other principle in
us, our <hi>conſciences;</hi> in joyning with the filth and
defilement thereof, in accuſing us and laying par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
to our cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ge; in which conſiſteth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of his ſtrength, even in an army of accuſations
of us to our ſelves; which in this warfare hee mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
up againſt us. This ſort of temptations (we
have in hand) conſiſts either of falſe <hi>majors,</hi> or
falſe <hi>minors;</hi> which are like the two wings of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
His falſe <hi>majors,</hi> they are ſuch, as miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the wayes and of the worke of grace, or
miſunderſtanding of ſayings of Scripture, &amp;c.
which by reaſon of that darknes of ignorance, that
is in us, he puts upon us wreſted and perverted. As
[That to relapſe into the ſame ſinne againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
is not compatible with grace] and many the
like. For the opinions whereby ſome doe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
what ſtrictneſſe is eſſentiall to the being in the
ſtate of grace, are often too ſevere and rigid; as in
others too looſe: The meaſure of ſome is too ſcant,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3405:50"/>
not giving allowance to failings; as of others too
large, taking in ſuch groſſe corruptions, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
practiſe of them as cannot ſtand with grace.
And Satan deceives with both: As the one ſort of
prophane men to flatter themſelves to be in a good
condition when they are not, ſo the other of weak
and tender conſciences, that they are not in a good
eſtate when they are. And in like maner places
of Scripture miſunderſtood, doe oft prove matter
of great temptation to many, as that <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 6.
unto One, who having fallen from his firſt love,
concluded he could never bee ſaved, becauſe it is
there ſaid, <hi>that they which are once enlightned, if they
fall away, it is impoſsible they ſhould be renewed to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi>
whereas it is onely to be underſtood of a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull
totall Apoſtaſie.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 13. 10.</note> Thus as <hi>Elymas perverted
the right wayes of the Lord:</hi> So doth Satan alſo, <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
being therefore there called <hi>child of the devill,</hi>
becauſe he did the work of his father therein. Now
all ſuch falſe reaſonings as are founded upon ſuch
miſtakes of the things, &amp; of the rule it ſelfe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we ſhould judge of our eſtates, <hi>falſe majors,</hi> do
properly belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to the former head of <hi>Carnall reaſon.</hi>
But he hath another wing of forces to joyn to theſe,
and they are falſe accuſations of a man to himſelfe,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the guilt of his own heart &amp; wayes, miſconceits
of a mans ſelfe, and miſapplications to a mans ſelf,
another ſort of arguments wherein the <hi>minors</hi> are
falſe. So as although a man be full of knowledge, &amp;
through the light thereof hath a right judgement
both of the Scriptures, &amp; of the wayes &amp; work of
grace by which mens eſtates are to be judged; &amp; ſo
therein Satan cannot be too hard for him with all
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3405:51"/>
his ſophiſtry: yet by miſrepreſenting a man to
himſelfe, and by perverting his owne wayes to
him, making <hi>that which is ſtraight, ſeeme crooked,</hi> and
all in him to bee hypocriſie, a man is brought to
paſſe a falſe ſentence upon himſelfe. So as if this
ſubtill pleader cannot deceive the judge (as I may
ſo ſpeake) with falſe rules and miſtakes in the Law
it ſelfe; then he endeavours it by miſrepreſenting
the caſe of the party, and puts in a falſe bill of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation,
ſo ordered and coloured as to procure a
judgement againſt him; laying afore the eyes of
mens conſciences their by-ends, deadneſſe and
hardneſſe of heart, and falſeneſſe in ſuch and ſuch
turning of their lives; excepting againſt what is
good in them; aggravating what is evill, and all to
enforce from thence a falſe concluſion. To inſtance
in ſome one falſe reaſoning: Satan oft argueth and
chargeth the conſcience of one diſtreſſed in this or
the like maner; <hi>Thoſe in whom any ſinne raigneth, or
in whoſe hearts hypocriſie and ſelfe-love is the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
principle, are not in the ſtate of grace: But ſuch an
one art thou, &amp;c.</hi> for the proof of which <hi>minor,</hi> he
muſters up and ſets in order in the view of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
a multitude of inſtances, of ſins committed,
thus hainouſly, thus oft; of duties omitted, and if
performed, yet with ſuch and ſuch pride of heart,
ſelf-aimes, &amp;c. In which ſort of reaſoning, the <hi>major</hi>
and firſt propoſition is often true: but the <hi>minor,</hi> the
aſſumption <hi>[ſuch an one art thou]</hi> is moſt falſe. And
although there be a truth in the inſtances alledged
to prove it: That ſuch ſins have been committed,
and that in performance of duties ſuch particular
by-ends, &amp;c. doe ariſe, and are found in the heart,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3405:51"/>
yet not in that manner, as hee would lay the
charge, not as <hi>raigning,</hi> not as the ſwaying and
prevailing principle in a mans whole courſe;
That hypocriſie is there, cannot be denyed: but
that hypocriſie rules there, and is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and that nothing but hypocriſie, this is it,
is falſe, which yet ſatan amazeth the conſcience
with, to bring forth this concluſion out of all,
<hi>Therefore thou art an hypocrite:</hi> which <hi>concluſion</hi>
likewiſe, how able hee is to ſet on with terrors
and affrightments, wee ſhall ſhew anon; That
which wee have now in hand, is to ſhew how
able he is, for thoſe kinde of falſe reaſonings:
the deceit of which lies chiefly in the <hi>aſſumption,</hi>
and <hi>minor</hi> propoſition, that, is in miſapplications
to a mans ſelfe; in which hee hath principally
to deale with <hi>conſcience:</hi> for the <hi>guilt</hi> of a mans

thoſe that heare the Goſpell, to <hi>enter into that
reſt,</hi> (to which hee had exhorted, ver. 11.)
which is ſet open by him for men now falne to
come into. Which <hi>ſword,</hi> as it hath a double
edge, (as there) ſo in his hand (who alone can
wield it) it ſerves to a double uſe: That whereas
in a Iudge two things are requiſite to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
performance of his office: 1. Skill and
knowledge to finde out and examine the fact:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3405:55"/>
2. Power to execute and torture the Malefactor
when found guilty. He ſhewes how both theſe
doe tranſcendently and ſolely-meet in him, by
what power is found to be in his <hi>word,</hi> which is
the enſigne of his juſtice, and inſtrument of his
power in judging, which is ſaid to be a <hi>diſcerner
of the thoughts,</hi> and a ſword that pierceth and
woundeth the ſoule and ſpirit with unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
anguiſh. Which wounding power is diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet forth (as ſome) from the beginning of the
12. ver. to thoſe laſt words, <hi>[and is a diſcerner of
the thoughts,]</hi> from whence to the end of the 13.
ver. that other, the ſearching and all-judging
property of God, &amp; his word is laid forth to us;
but rather as I conceive, the Apoſtle in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
metaphor carries along the expreſſion of
both through the whole, though more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
the one in that former part of the words,
and the other in the later: yet ſo as both are alike
made <hi>The royalty of God,</hi> which is the thing we
have in hand. Neither needs it ſtumble any that
this is attributed to the word of God, of which
he ſeems to ſpeak, for that is all one, &amp; to aſcribe
it unto God: for as where the word of a King is,
there is power, ſayes <hi>Solomon, Eccles</hi> 8. 4. ſo,
where the word of God is, there is the power of
God, &amp; ſo is it here to be underſtood: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as in other Scriptures his word is ſaid to <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi>
&amp; <hi>by it the heavens to be eſtabliſht, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; alſo,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. in the like phraſe of ſpeech, the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is ſaid to <hi>foreſee,</hi> that is, God foreſaw, who
writ the Scripture: ſo alſo here, to <hi>know,</hi> and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3405:55"/>
                  <hi>wound</hi> the heart. Which to be the Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
intention here, appears by the connexion
of the 12. and 13. verſes. For whereas ver. 12.
he begins with attributing this power unto the
word, yet in the end hee cloſeth his ſpeech with
transferring all that was ſaid thereof upon God
himſelfe. ver. 13. <hi>with whom we have to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To open the words a little more largely, ſo as
to clear this aſſertion out of them, which it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to premiſe. The words are,</hi> For the word
of God is quick and powerfull, and ſharper then any
two edged ſword, piercing to the dividing aſunder
of ſoule and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow, and
is a diſcerner of the thoughts, and intents of the
heart, neither is there any creature that is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
in his ſight, but all things are naked and
opened to the eyes of him with whom wee have to
doe.</p>
               <p>And firſt, of that ſole ſearching power of the
ſoul in this Chapter, and of that other, the ſole
wounding power of the conſcience, in the next
Chap. we ſhal have the like occaſion to premiſe.</p>
               <p>For the preſent, that ſearching, examining, &amp;
judging power of the word now in hand, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
by an alluſion to the anatomy of bodies:
(which then, though not ſo frequently as now,
was yet in uſe) or elſe to the cutting up of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
whether thoſe of the Iews, or as it was
uſed among the heathen; eſpecially by the
Soothſayers, who curiouſly ſearched into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inward part, as we find in the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
21. 21. and his ſimilitude ſtands then, that looke
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3405:56"/>
what the entrailes are to a ſharp ſword, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers
knife, or the like inſtruments of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
in a ſtrong and skilfull hand, ſuch are all
the moſt inward, and ſecret parts of the heart,
even thoſe which are moſt difficult to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
unto this ſword in Gods hand, when hee is
pleaſed to uſe it to ſearch the heart and reynes,
and to diſcover and bring forth to judgement
the ſecrets thereof. Hee can uſe this ſword, not
onely to unrip, &amp; ſtrip off the outward cloathes
of outward and formall actions, and ſo preſent
the ſoule <hi>naked,</hi> (as his expreſſion is, ver. 13.)
nor only to flea off all the skin, to excoriate, and
ſo to ſee what lies under it, (as the next word
there <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is tranſlated opened,
doth ſometimes ſignifie) but further to cleave
and cut up to the back bone (for even ſo deep
doth the ſignification of that word reach) that
ſo all the inwards may appear; and this ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
divided &amp; laid aſunder, as to ſee &amp; view a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
what is in each. <hi>It pierceth to the dividing
aſunder of ſoule and ſpirit.</hi> By which, <hi>grace</hi> and
<hi>corruption</hi> are not ſo properly here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood:
for then he would have rather ſaid, <hi>fleſh</hi>
and <hi>ſpirit:</hi> and beſides the perſons hee ſpeaks
this of, are principally thoſe who ſhall be
found ſecret unbeleevers, who have not <hi>ſpirit</hi>
in that ſenſe at all in them: but they are here
uſed to expreſſe thoſe two maine powers of the
heart. The <hi>ſoule,</hi> that is the inferiour part, that
more ſenſuall part, wherein the affections are,
(as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 20. it is alſo uſed) which it divides
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3405:56"/>
by diſcovering how cloſe &amp; inordinatly all thoſe
affections cleave to ſin: and then 2. of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi>
that is the ſuperiour part of the <hi>underſtanding
conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. which it rips up by diſcovering
how theſe plot, and contrive the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſinne. <hi>Dividing,</hi> that is, diſcovering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
with difference, how things are carryed
ſeverally in each: and withall, what correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
and entercourſe there is betweene theſe;
how ſin and all our actions paſſe through them
from the one to the other, even as bloud and
ſpirits doe through the veines and arteries, in all
the parts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> each to other. And as in the body,
there are ſeverall <hi>regions</hi> (as Anatomiſts call
them) divided by partitions: the <hi>vitall parts</hi> in
the upper loft next the neck, in which are lodged
the heart, and lungs: The <hi>naturall parts</hi> in that
lower, and theſe divided by the midriffe, as by a
floore betweene them: ſo in the ſoule, (to which
haply <hi>Solomon</hi> alludes, when <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 27. hee
calls the ſeverall powers of it, <hi>The Chambers of
the belly,</hi> as ſome read it.) there is the ſenſual part
of the affections, <hi>The ſoul,</hi> &amp;c. which is as it were
in a diſtinct room from that more ſublime &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
part, <hi>the ſpirit.</hi> And as the <hi>ſpirit of man,</hi>
that is, the conſcience and underſtanding of a
man, <hi>ſearcheth all thoſe cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers,</hi> (as tis there,) that
is, <hi>Knows what is in man;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. (which yet when it doth ſo, it is not
by an innate light, but with <hi>Gods candle,</hi> as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
expreſſion there is: that is, by the word
and the light thereof ſet up by him in it.) So
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3405:57"/>
here, the word, under another ſimilitude, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of a ſword, is ſaid to cut up, and to diſcover
all within thoſe ſeverall regions. And in the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> it is ſaid to diſcover what can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
moſt retired and withdrawne, and ſo lockt
up, as no eye could finde it out, which he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
by mentioning ſuch parts, as are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſeated of all other: <hi>the marrow,</hi> which
wee know is incloſed within the bones: and <hi>the
joynts,</hi> or ligaments, by which the joynts are
knit, and move; theſe it unbares, and diſcovers
alſo. Both which hee interprets in the next
words, [and is a <hi>diſcoverer of the thoughts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of the heart,]</hi> which are a more plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of what he had expreſſed by thoſe
two metaphors. The utmoſt <hi>intention</hi> and end,
in all our actions, that is as the <hi>marrow,</hi> becauſe
as the marrow gives moiſture to the bones, ſo
by theſe our ends all our purpoſes and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(by which we are ſupported in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
are ſtrengthned and confirmed: and then
our deviſing <hi>thoughts</hi> or plottings, our contrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and machinations, thoſe by which wee
artificially doe connect, and hang together ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
joynts of meanes, to accompliſh and bring
to paſſe our intentions: (which thoughts of all
other we ſtrive to hide and conceale) theſe are
as the <hi>joynts,</hi> or (as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> rather implies)
as the ligaments, and the ſinews, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
by which the joynts doe move, ſo theſe
are they upon which our deſigns doe move and
turne. Even all thoſe <hi>cogitationes compaginatae,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:3405:57"/>
plotting thoughts, the word, it diſcovers and
cuts up, and alſo judgeth, and examineth, and
paſſeth ſentence upon them: yea and that ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
as not the ſmalleſt fault can paſſe uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
by it: it is as a curious Critique in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view:
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it judgeth exactly, as Critiques uſe
to doe. So as by this anatomy, which the word
makes, <hi>all things</hi> in man, <hi>every creature,</hi> even the
leaſt <hi>Fibra,</hi> the ſmalleſt ſtring in the heart which
would eſcape the ſight of the moſt exact Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſt,
are all <hi>naked,</hi> and <hi>opened,</hi> and cut up <hi>afore
the eyes of him with whom we have to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons why God hath reſerved this to
himſelf,<note place="margin">The reaſons.</note> are, 1. It was for the glory of God, that
hee ſhould have one private cabinet among the
creatures, which hee alone ſhould know, and
keep the key of, which might argue his omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
as alſo one place to be ſanctified in, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no creatures eye could pierce: That ſo the
greatneſſe of his glory might appeare, namely,
in this, that he is not worſhipped outwardly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as great ones are, but inwardly <hi>in ſpirit and
truth:</hi> and that his glory is ſuch, as commands the
inward parts, which no eye ſeeth but his own:
ſo as a man will reſpect God ſo much as to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
him in ſecret when no creature looks upon
him.</p>
               <p>2. That God alone might be the Iudge and
rewarder of mens wayes: and ſo look'd at by
them, to whom alone men muſt give an account:
which would draw the creatures eye alone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, when the ſtrength and firſt borne of all
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3405:58"/>
our actions, are his ſubjects alone, and do come
under his eye and view. Therefore it is ſaid,
that hee <hi>rewards men according to their works,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 8 39.</note>
                  <hi>whoſe heart he knowes.</hi> It was fit, that hee onely
ſhould take upon him to reward, who only could
know the principles of all actions, in which
the chiefe of the good or evill in the action lies.
This is the great glory of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the
day of judgement, that <hi>they will diſcover the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of all hearts, 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 5. It is not ſaid ſo
much of mens actions, that they ſhall be then
diſcovered, as that the ſecrets of their hearts:
For therein lies Gods glory, which he will not
give to any other.</p>
               <p>This premiſed as a moſt neceſſary Caution,<note place="margin">§ 2.</note> I

them to our charge: and ſo often hit right
therein, &amp; ſpeake a mans heart thus at randome.
For our natures are apt to bring forth <hi>all concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence,</hi>
as the Apoſtle ſayes <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Therefore
if there were no more; then that hee knowes all
temptations <hi>common</hi> to <hi>mans</hi> nature, hee might
goe far in accuſing every man; he having keyes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3405:58"/>
of all ſorts, ſorted to all mens ſpirits, tryes with
every one which will enter. And as <hi>Davids</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
brother charged <hi>David,</hi> when he came into
the warres, <hi>This is the pride and the naughtineſſe
of thy heart,</hi> gueſſing at his by-ends in it: ſo doth
ſatan; hee often in like manner charges us by
gueſſe. Thus he did <hi>Iob, Doth Iob ſerve God for
nought?</hi> hee knew ſuch by-ends were in ſome
mens hearts, and ſo ventures to lay them to <hi>Iobs</hi>
charge alſo.</p>
               <p>2. Though he ſhould know very little of us,<note place="margin">2. By caſting in a jealous thought from ſome one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular he knows by us he might ſet the heart awake to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all the reſt.</note>
yet he may from ſome one particular which hee
doth know or ſuſpect, caſt in a ſuſpitious thought
about a mans eſtate: and ſo ſet the jealous heart
aworke it ſelfe to ſearch out more matter againſt
it ſelfe. As in caſe of treaſon, the leaſt hint given
by ſome one, ſets the State aworke to examine
the bottome of the buſineſſe, and ſo to get all
out. So as ſatan often gives, and caſts in but a
ſcruple, which proves as a theame for the heart
it ſelfe to dilate upon, and the conſcience upon
enquirie finds matter againſt it ſelf to prove and
encreaſe that ſurmiſe. Thus in generall.</p>
               <p>But 2. he may more particularly know much
againſt us to accuſe us of,<note place="margin">2. More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</note> and ſo frame bills a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us out of what hee knowes,<note place="margin">He may know,</note> and this firſt
ſuppoſing he had no acceſſe to our inward parts,

in, with all our more privy corruptions, as leſſer

hath by meanes of the accuſing of one foule act,
given way to doubting, then all other privy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
joyne and offer themſelves to accuſe

               <p>2. Alſo he may by this be able to accuſe us of

As 1. by comparing one action with another,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
one ſpeech with another: ſo wiſe men gueſſe at
mens ends in things, and their reſpects that
move them. 2. By geſtures. By a caſt of a mans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
countenance and behaviour, men are often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
by the like may ſatan ſee into us. Thus
<hi>Ioab</hi> diſcerned <hi>Davids</hi> pride in his comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for
numbring the people, ſo as it was loathſome in
his eyes. And if <hi>Ioab</hi> diſcerned this by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
carriage of the matter, how much more
might ſatan that put in the motives to perſwade
him to it? The Ieſuits bid thoſe of their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
who are to deale with men, when they talke
with any, whoſe minds they would diſcern, ſtill
to obſerve their eye, to ſee what alterations are
in their countenances, as through which the
minde is tranſparent; now ſatan, hee is a good
Phiſiognomiſt, and he eyes a man. 3. Further <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
he himſelfe ſuggeſting many motives, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in buſineſſes this way and that way, caſting
in many by-ends, and motives to be conſidered
by us, he obſervs how the heart comes off at ſuch
and ſuch ſuggeſtions, or where it ſtuck, and what
ſuggeſtion it was that turned a man this way or
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3405:61"/>
that way, and fetcht him off. The Iewes might
ſee what moved <hi>Pilate</hi> to crucifie Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
at that ſaying, as the Text notes, <hi>that elſe
he was an enemy to Caeſar,</hi> hee gave ſentence: ſo
ſatan, when he ſtirred up <hi>David</hi> by proud argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to number the people, hee muſt needs
know what pride was in his heart.</p>
               <p>Now 6. beſides all this,<note place="margin">6. That he may further view the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and alſo the paſſions in the body.</note> how farre hee may
have an inſight into the <hi>Fancy,</hi> and the images
therein, which follow and imitate the inward
thoughts of the minde, as the ſhadow doth the
body: and alſo into the <hi>paſsions,</hi> which are but
the <hi>flowing,</hi> and <hi>reflowing of corporeall ſpirits,</hi> and
in which the affections of the will diſcover
themſelves, this I leave to others to determine.
For the preſent, this is certaine, that although
all the powers of the reaſonable ſoule bee faſt
lockt up from him (as we ſhall ſhew) and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
acts which are imminent in the ſoule it
ſelfe, utterly hidden from him, and that, take the
ſoul as it is the immediate ſubject, &amp; root of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
ſo, <hi>intuitive,</hi> no devill can diſcerne them, no
more then one Angell can diſcern the thoughts
of another; yet <hi>arguitive,</hi> and as they doe <hi>tranſire</hi>
and appeare, and are put forth in the body and
corporeall organs outwardly in actions, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in paſſions, and ſo <hi>quaſi in alio,</hi> and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
they may be very far diſcerned, and lookt
into by Angels. Which yet will nothing at all
pre-judge that prerogative which is given to
God, when he is ſaid alone to know &amp; ſearch the
heart, but give its full allowance; nor that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3405:61"/>
which is given to the ſoul it ſelf to enjoy,
namely,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note> that <hi>none ſhould know the things of a man,
but the ſpirit that is in man:</hi> as we ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſhew in the Appendix to this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides, therefore, theſe advantages and
wayes of knowledge, ſomewhat common to
us men, each of other, they have a further, and
and more neere way of knowing the acts of the
reaſonable powers, the underſtanding, and will,
then we men can have, even as they have alſo a
way of communicating their thoughts to us in a
more intimate, cloſe, ſecret manner: yet ſtill
ſuch, as falls ſhort of an <hi>intuitive</hi> knowledge of
them: they can goe into a roome further then
wee: and into a roome which is next the privy
chamber, which yet remaines faſt lockt up unto
them. As their power in all other things reacheth
a degree higher then ours, ſo in this alſo. To
open this a little.</p>
               <p>Thoſe reaſonable powers and faculties in us,
<hi>the underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>the will,</hi> the immediate
immanent acts of which are thus in themſelves
faſt lockt up, being yet in this life drencht in the
body, and bodily organs, upon which their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
doth depend: As 1. The underſtanding is
joyned to the fancy, which makes <hi>parelii,</hi> and
reſemblances and ſhadowes of thoſe thoughts
the minde ſecretly conceives and formes; ſo as
ſcarce any thoughts doe ſtir, but the fancie imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
them, and acts them as far as it is able. And
2. The will alſo is conjoyned with the affections
which are drencht, and ſhew themſelves in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3405:62"/>
organs and ſpirits, ſo as not any motion of
the will puts it ſelf forth, but more or leſſe ſome
affections of the bodie doe ſtirre with it; and
therefore affections are as well defined by their
motion in the body, as by their ſeat in the will
it ſelfe. As when anger is defined, <hi>ira eſt ebullitio
ſanguinis circa cor,</hi> a boiling of bloud about the
heart; and affections are but the flowings and
reflowings of ſpirits to and from the heart.</p>
               <p>Now both theſe, both <hi>phantaſmes</hi> and <hi>paſsions,</hi>
all divines doe grant that the devills may know;
and that to know them they have a nearer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
to us, then men can have each to other:
yea, and that they may diſcern them, <hi>intuirivè,</hi>
as we do things which are preſent before us, how
elſe ſhould they worke upon fancy? and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
there were no diabolicall dreames, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
neither, cauſed by good angels. But we
finde that a good angell dictated to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a
great article of faith, <hi>[Chriſts divinity, and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity]</hi>
it was done in a dreame; and therefore to
his fancy. So they inſpired the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated
prophecies as was ſaid. And ſo the <hi>evill
angells</hi> prompted <hi>Sauls fancy.</hi> And this they
doe, not by creating new ſpecies and images,
but <hi>evocando,</hi> calling forth the images there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
For the images of things in the fancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
corporeall ſpecies, they can no more beget
a new corporeall image, then they can make a
body anew. And therefore all the power of the
angels cannot cauſe a blinde man to dreame of
colours. And therefore their way in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3405:62"/>
their ſuggeſtions to us herein, muſt be
by diſcerning the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> to wit, of all words
heard or read, that lye in the fancy already; and
ſo by ordering and compoſing them, even as a
Compoſitor in printing doth his letters that lye
confuſed afore him, into words and ſentences,
to repreſent to the readers eye what hee would
have read by him: So he to the underſtanding,
which naturally prints off from the fancy what
ever is in it, as faſt as he doth ſet them. And by
the like reaſon, that he can call them forth, and
ſo view the ſpecies and images laid up there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
to ſet them thus as he pleaſeth, by the
ſame reaſon it muſt be ſuppoſed that he is as able
to diſcerne any of them in the fancy at any time,
then when reaſon it ſelfe calls up any of them,
and maketh uſe of them, as it doth when ever
it ſets it ſelfe to thinke or muſe; and theſe and
all operations of the ſenſitive powers they may
view and ſee as truly (for ought I know) and as
intuitively, even as wee ſee colours and ſpecies
of things in the eye of a man. So as theſe evill
angels, may when God permits, get into the
head, and ſee all the images and ſpecies in the
fancy, and thoſe that are in direct conjunction
with the underſtanding, which it is then thinking
and muſing of: even as a man doth what images
are in the apple of the eye of another man: and
ſo by diſcerning thoſe <hi>phantaſmes,</hi> which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
actually then vieweth and makes
uſe of, he may then judge what the minde is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:3405:63"/>
And againe, as wee diſcerne mens paſſions
when they dye and affect the outward parts, as
if ſhame dyes the face red, and feare paints it
white; ſo may the angels more ſecretly diſcerne
the motion of them within, which is the cauſe
of this alteration without; they can goe further,
and ſee the inward commotion of the ſpirits in
our inward parts, even in their channels and
ſprings, in that bodily heart we cary within us,
and in the veines and arteries, and ſo know what
affections are ſtirring. And this is evident by this,
in that they are alſo able to worke upon theſe
paſſions. Now their power of working on the
affections, ariſeth from their knowing them, and
skill to move and ſtir thoſe ſpirits and humours
<hi>electively,</hi> wherein theſe <hi>paſsions</hi> are ſeated. And
herein their power of diſcerning us, exceeds
<hi>that</hi> in us men, in diſcerning other men; as that
of communicating their mindes to us alſo doth.
For as they can communicate ſecretly by fancy
it ſelfe; we but by outward words, and ſignes to
the outward ſenſes of others; ſo they can diſcern
more ſecretly what is in the fancy, and not only
what appeares in the outward parts; which is
yet but a roome further, that they get into,
which we men cannot come to; ſo as they can
diſcern the leaſt riſing of the tide, the leaſt turn
of the ſtreame of affections in our veines, and in
the corporeall heart, Satan can diſcerne thoſe
leſſer aguiſh fits of paſſion that accompanies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
act of the will, which men diſcerne not. But
of this great and neceſſary <hi>quaere;</hi> as alſo how by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3405:63"/>

of venome and malice, to wound mens
names with; even as on the contrary, the Holy
Ghoſt did ſet on fire the Apoſtles tongues with

thoſe darts he wounds the conſcience with, and
thereby augments our feares and griefes, and ſo

As <hi>Chriſt</hi> is that <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> ſo <hi>Satan</hi>
is that <hi>fiery Serpent,</hi> that can ſting us by the guilt
of ſinne.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt bring in the like caution as I
uſed in the former Chapter;<note place="margin">A Caution.</note> namely, that hee
works not theſe terrors by immediate impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the conſcience, which in that reſpect
is ſubject to Gods ſtroke alone, as to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
alone. Which as I intimated, I take to
be that other principall part of the drift of thoſe
words; <hi>Heb. 4. 11, 12. The word of God is quick
and powerfull, &amp;c.</hi> For there he ſets forth Chriſt
to us (as was ſhewed) as a judge compleatly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for vengeance againſt us, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of an omniſciency to finde us out in all our

much feared, if he had only skill and knowledge

out the guile and guilt of malefactors, if he were
not armed with power to avenge, and torture

them) therefore withall, the Apoſtles ſcope is
to ſtrike terrour into their hearts, in reſpect of
that vengeance he can execute, and therefore
his aime is to exhort them, not to dally with
God, or with his word, in which he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

purport of the words muſt neceſſarily alſo bee
ſuppoſed to be, to ſhew the dreadfull power of
God, and of his word, in avenging it ſelfe upon
the contemners of him and it, and not meerely
to deſcribe his omniſcience, and knowing of the

vengeance, and more eſpecially in the prophecy

And indeed, whatſoever doth torment, or

into their hearts in reſpect of the wounds,<note place="margin">Iſay 49. 2.</note>
and torments it inflicts; he goes further on to
exaggerate the dread thereof, hee ſayes not
onely that it is as ſharpe, but <hi>more ſharpe,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:3405:67"/>
not then a ſword of one edge, but then a <hi>two-edged
ſword,</hi> nor then ſome, but then <hi>any</hi> two-edged
ſword; and further, to ſhew that hee
ſpeakes it in relation unto wounding, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
and torment it cauſeth in the ſoule; hee
mentioneth the diviſion of ſuch parts as are not
onely moſt hid, and inward, in relation to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
(for ſuch the marrow is being covered
with the bones, and the ligaments covered with
fleſh) but which are alſo of moſt exquiſite ſenſe,
and the wounding of which cauſeth the greateſt
dolour. Hee ſaith, it <hi>pierceth</hi> even through <hi>the
bones,</hi> which it muſt needs bee ſuppoſed to doe,
when it is ſaid to reach unto the <hi>marrow.</hi> Now
the breaking of the bones is ſtill put to expreſſe
thoſe exquiſite and unſupportable terrours and
dolours of conſcience, and woundings of the
<hi>Spirit which a man cannot beare,</hi> or ſuſtaine.
For when the bones are broken, a man cannot
ſtand nor ſupport himſelfe. And the like is alſo
the cutting of the ligaments, the nerves, ſinewes,
and arteries, thoſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,
that is, the <hi>Spirit alſo,</hi> which is with an

much that it divideth the ſoule <hi>from</hi> the ſpirit,
(as ſome have underſtood it) but the ſoule <hi>and</hi>
ſpirit alſo. It is a two-edged ſword, and can at

they lye <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, even with their throats
cut, dead and ſpeechleſſe at his feet, as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret</hi>
expounds that word. Now thus far, that
is, to this <hi>ſpirit</hi> in man, no created ſword can
reach; they turne edge at it: but even this, the
word reacheth, &amp; that alone. So as the ſummary
drift of all herein, is the ſame which Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
elſewhere in other words, to exhort
them to <hi>feare that God,</hi> whoſe ſword, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
word is able thus to wound, &amp; who is alone
able thus to do; and <hi>not to feare thoſe who can only</hi>

ſoul that is drencht in it, but cannot wound or
kill the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Which God alone can do, and no

(as alſo through this diſcourſe) we are to ſet
ſuch bounds, as that this incommunicable roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of God, and of his word, may be reſerved
unentrencht upon; namely, that he alone knows,

both which, at once this place held out

               <p>But yet although Satan cannot immediately

Gods wrath upon it: (for as no creature can ſhed

2 Cor. 10. 6. With the ratling of which
chaines, Satan can make a noiſe in the conſcience
of a poore ſinner, to affright him. Which hee
is the more enabled to doe, out of experience of

is the more powerfull to terrifie weake conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
that are enſnared with the cords of their
owne ſinnes, by reaſon of the terrours which he
hath received from the Lord. And therefore in
Scripture, as a power <hi>in ſin</hi> is attributed to him,
ſo the <hi>power of death.</hi> Heb. 2. 14. Where, by <hi>death</hi>
is meant not ſo much that bodily, as that eternall
death, to which, as the proper puniſhment of ſin,
the guilt of it doth binde us over. Which power
of his is not that of the Iudge in ſentencing to
death, or caſting men to hell, which is a ſpeciall
flower of Chriſts Crowne; who Rev. 1. 18. <hi>hath
the keyes of hell &amp; death</hi> at his girdle; &amp; of Gods,
who is therefore onely to be <hi>feared,</hi> becauſe, <hi>he
onely can caſt body and ſoule into hell.</hi> Nor is it as
if he were the main tormenter, and executioner
of mens ſouls, after that great day, ſeeing that
they are to be tormented by that fire which in
common, <hi>was prepared for the devills themſelves.</hi>
And who is it that doth torment them? but
it is therefore principally meant 1. of that
power and advantage he obtained over ſinners,
when he had ſeduced them; ſo, as to come bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a pleader againſt them, enabled with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to urge Gods righteous law and word, and
to call upon, and to provoke his juſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3405:69"/>
poore ſinners: till Chriſt that righteous
advocate diſpoyled him of his pleas and power,
by that ſatisfaction of his; which before, the law
had put into his hands; and ſo <hi>Hee deſtroyed him
that had the power of death;</hi> and enervated all his
pleas and terrours. And 2. the meaning is, that
as he hath this power in Gods court, ſo alſo in
our conſciences, to urge the law upon us, and to
plead all that the <hi>Law ſayes to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> under the Law;</hi>

remaines, ſo farre they may be ſubject to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by him that hath power of death; over
thoſe that are in any degree ſubject to the feare
of it.</p>
               <p>And 4.<note place="margin">4. He can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of feare, and trembling of ſpirit.</note> Hee can immediately, by his owne
power, ſtirre the paſſions of feare and griefe, &amp;c.
Excite them beyond nature, as the windes can
raiſe the billowes in the ſea, and make the floods
to make a noiſe; ſo can hee a tumult in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

lightnings, as ſhall hurle all into a black confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
ſuch, as if hell and the ſoule would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come together. And though it is true, that
he cannot turne the ſtreame and current of our
affections back (God onely can turne this Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan

them to ſwell above their naturall channels;

2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24? againſt all reaſon, as well as

to doe an act ſo <hi>fooliſh,</hi> (as himſelfe ſaw

6. (one that ſeemeth by his other cariages to
have had but nature in him.) But the devil was in
it. So verſe the 1. <hi>Satan provoked David to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the people,</hi> by raiſing up ſuch an affection and
inclination in him. The like appeares in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of love, which how ſtrongly hath Satan
drawne forth in ſome, even to madneſſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3405:70"/>
ſuch, as before, and alſo after his faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was overpaſt, they have loathed and hated
above all others, is evident in ſtories by many
inſtances. And as he can raiſe up other <hi>paſsions</hi>
in us, ſo alſo <hi>feares</hi> and <hi>terrours, jealouſies,</hi> and
<hi>diſtruſts. To feare where no feare is.</hi> And thus he
handled <hi>Saul</hi> (when God left him to him) <hi>An
evill ſpirit from the Lord troubled him;</hi> or (as
moſt reade it, and our margent varies it) <hi>terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him.</hi> 1 Sam. 16. 15. And in the raiſing up
of theſe affections of feare, and the like; hee
workes more then ſimply <hi>morally,</hi> that is, then
by bare propounding ſuch objects as ſhall move
them; (which men onely can doe) but further
alſo, <hi>Phyſically,</hi> by ſtirring ſuch humours in the
body, which ſuch paſſions doe act and ſtirre in.
And ſo thoſe humors in the body, which ſhal put
a man into a timorous, and trembling diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he can <hi>electively</hi> worke upon, as he pleaſeth.
And then alſo he can diſturbe the <hi>phantaſmes</hi> in
the head, the organs of the underſtanding; as in
him, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 35. Who through Satans working
is intimated, <hi>not to have beene in his right minde.</hi>
And when he hath thus diſtempered, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
all in a man, and put a man into ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
to feares, &amp;c. then he comes with his
ſuggeſtions, and ſpeakes nothing but of wrath,
and terrours, and of the threatnings, and of the
hainouſneſſe of a mans ſinnes, the fearefulneſſe
of Gods wrath, &amp;c. to the conſcience that is
troubled; and then (looke as when a mans chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
is up, every ſmall thing provokes him; ſo
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3405:71"/>
now when feare and melancholy are encited,
every ſuggeſtion, every ſurmiſe doth ſtriketh:
ſoule through and through, with horrid feares
and jealouſies. And thus, though not <hi>immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly,</hi>
yet through the meanes of theſe miſts and
vapours, and fogges raiſed, which environ and
darken this ſunne, he workes upon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and therefore we ſee by experience, that
he prevailes moſt in this ſort of temptations,
with melancholly te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pers; who dwelling in dark
ſhops, he much deceives with falſe colours and
gloſſes. And when affections are up, and doe
cloud the minde, then multitudes of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
thoughts ariſe, and every ſuggeſtion ſutable
to that paſſion takes, and prevailes with a
mans ſpirit; as appeares by that ſpeech of Chriſt
<hi>Luke 24. 38. Why are you troubled</hi> (or <hi>afraid)
and why doe thoughts ariſe in your hearts?</hi> Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
like to heavy weights hung upon a clock, do
not onely make the wheeles, the thoughts move
faſter; but alſo perverts them, &amp; wreſts them the
wrong way; ſo as to a heart thus diſtempered, all
things come to be preſented amiſſe; even as to a
bloodſhot eye all things ſeeme red. In a word,
as he deludes his Enthuſiaſts by ſetting on, and
backing thier falſe opinions, and illuſions, with
joyes and raviſhments of ſpirit (which differ as
much from the joyes of the holy Ghoſt which
are <hi>unſpeakable</hi> and <hi>glorious,</hi> as heaven from
earth.) So he can, and doth back his falſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,
and accuſations to holy men about their
eſtates, with abundance of terrour and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3405:71"/>
which alſo differs as much from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Gods wrath made immediately by
the ſpirit upon the conſcience, as thoſe joyes are
found to doe.</p>

which have beene related.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">§ 1.</note> it is no ſmall advantage, that he can fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly,<note place="margin">1. Advantage, that he can and doth ſuggeſt frequently and familiarly.</note>

againe unto us. The frequency of any thought
that comes in againe and againe, that lies by us,

to perſwade us to thinke it is ſo. Wee uſe
to ſay [I have thought ſo againe and againe] A
cunning flatterer, that is continually ſuggeſting,
and taking all hints and occaſions ſo to doe, may
at laſt put hard to worke out a neare and a deare

So is the minde apt to yeeld a ſuggeſtion that

               <p>And 2. hee can alſo (and doth) repreſent a

               <p>4. He addes weight to his lying accuſations,<note place="margin">4. That hee backs all with an imperious affirmation.</note>
and falſe reaſonings by an imperious and obſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3405:73"/>
affirmation [that ſo it is,] hee ſuggeſts
not reaſons onely, that ſhould perſwade, but
ſets them on with words of affirmation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
therewithall ſuggeſted: and ſo, like as in
reaſoning, often a weake ſpirit is borne downe
by a ſtronger, not by force of argument ſo much,
as by ſtrength and violence of ſpirit; for many
when the <hi>iron is blunt,</hi> and their arguments
<hi>want edge, put to the more ſtrength,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi>
ſpeakes. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 10. and ſo prevaile: and
ſo doth Satan; being a ſpirit of greater ſtrength
then ours by creation; and guilt alſo, further
weakning us in arguing with him. Cunning plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
may ſo argue the caſe, with ſuch violence
and confidence, that as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid when his
accuſers had done, that if he had not been very
innocent, hee ſhould have ſuſpected himſelfe
guilty: how much more, when this ſhall fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
perſons that are ſo guilty, as we all are; and
the thing alſo impleaded be that which wee are
already ſuſpitious of? What a man feares al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
he eaſily beleeves, as what a man hopes,
<hi>quod metuunt facile credunt.</hi> There falls out of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in opinions a preconceit which alſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
ſwayes the minde, a giving of minde that
ſuch a thing is ſo or ſo; and in ſuch a caſe <hi>Satan</hi>
can ſtrike in exceedingly to ſtrengthen ſuch a
conceit: this I take to be implyed in that phraſe.
2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 1. I Where the Apoſtle gives warning
they ſhould not be troubled <hi>neither</hi> [by <hi>ſpirit]
nor by word, to thinke the day of Iudgement was at
hand:</hi> By <hi>ſpirit</hi> he meanes a pretence of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3405:73"/>
joyned with a mans owne private conceit
and imagination; thus 1 <hi>Iohn 4. 1. Spirit</hi> is alſo
taken. And oftentimes when Satan perceives
the minde inclined to thinke or conceit thus or
thus, he addes weight unto the ballance, and ſo
a man is given up to the efficacy of deluſion: as
wee ſee in falſe Prophets which the Apoſtle
there ſpeakes of, when he ſayes, <hi>Beleeve not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſpirit, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out
into the world.</hi> Thus thoſe falſe Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
confident in their prophecies: <hi>they walke
in the ſpirit</hi> ſayes the Prophet, <hi>Micah 2. 11. But
doe lye.</hi> They tooke up ſuch conceits, and the
devill hee joyned with them, and confirmed
them in them. And as Satan by ſuch falſe reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
confirmes Enthuſiaſts in their opinions
and conceits: ſo he joynes with the jealouſies
of beleevers, and puts weight into the ballance,
ſtrongly ſwaying them to judge amiſſe of their
eſtates.</p>
               <p>And 5. in that hee,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> as was ſaid, backeth his
falſe concluſions thence deduced,<note place="margin">5. That his reaſonings are backt with ſenſe of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</note> with <hi>terrours,</hi>
&amp;c. this becomes an argument to ſenſe; and
ſuch doe exceedingly carry on the judgement in
our opinion of things. A conceit that comes in
with joy, we are apt to conclude is true; and ſo
in like maner what comes in with terrour: ſuch
impreſſions are as it were a ſeal to what is ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
to confirm it. And as the holy Ghoſt <hi>ſealeth
his inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> Iob 33. 16. with impreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of joy,
&amp;c. ſo doth Satan his temptations with impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of feare and diſquietment. If a man hath a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3405:74"/>
dreame with any ſtrong impreſſion, a man is apt
to give heed to it, to thinke there is ſomething
in it: that which made <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> thinke
there muſt needs bee ſomething in his, <hi>Daniel</hi>
Chap. 2. and Chap. 4. When yet hee had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
what it was, was, that it made <hi>him afraid, and
his thoughts troubled him.</hi> ver. 5.</p>
               <p>A 6.<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> Advantage is, that hee ſuggeſts and
workes all theſe impreſſions undiſcerned at all
to be from him,<note place="margin">6. That he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts all undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by us.</note> ſo as we know not but they are
our owne thoughts, yea ſometimes thinke that
they be from the holy Ghoſt, working as the
Spirit of bondage in us. This is alſo an exceeding
great advantage, as it would be to an enemy to
have gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the oppoſites own watchword, their
owne colours: this cauſeth us readily to yeeld
and open the gates to him: and though when
the temptation is over we perceive his deluſion
in it, yet ſtill becauſe we cannot diſcerne his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
from our owne thoughts when upon
us, when we are in the miſt and eclipſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hee can come againe and againe with the
ſame temptation, to day, and to morrow, and
the next day, and we perceive it not; which if
we did, we ſhould not liſten to it, no more then
wee would to one who had formerly deceived
us. Thus <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets knew not that Satan
was a lying ſpirit in them, for ſayes one of them
unto Micaiah, <hi>When went the Spirit of God from
me to you?</hi> Thoſe ſtrong deluſions, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10.
could not have prevailed upon their mindes to
have beleeved a lie, had it beene diſcerned by
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3405:74"/>
them that Satan had ſuggeſted them. <hi>Peter</hi> knew
no that Satan did by him tempt <hi>his maſter to
ſpare himſelfe;</hi> which yet Chriſt perceived, and
therefore called him Satan.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> a man can no way avoide his ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,<note place="margin">7. That his ſuggeſtions cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</note>
nor ſubduce himſelfe from them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any take Satan off from a man but God;
he muſt rebuke him, none elſe can. A poore
ſoule fights with Satan in this darkneſſe, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a man that is aſſaulted by one that carries a
darke lanterne, who can ſee the aſſaulted, and
how to buffet him, and followes him where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he goes, whereas the poore man cannot fee
him, nor who it is that ſtrikes him, nor be aware
how to award the blow. Therefore the Apoſtle
when <hi>buffeted</hi> by Satan,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> knew not what to doe,
but onely to have recourſe to God by prayer:
for he could no more avoid or runne away from
thoſe ſuggeſtions, then from himſelfe. Nor
could all the Saints on earth any other way have
freed him; none, till God ſhould cauſe him to
depart.</p>

thought by ſome, to be ſet up as a type among

was to be left by his Apoſtles, and all, forſaken

pierced further in the end, and ſeized upon his

ſpirit, (though not ſo farre as to queſtion Gods
love to him, this we reade no where of him, yet
was) ſeene in Gods withdrawing himſelfe in the
comfort of his preſence, and Satans making him
a Butt to ſpend his arrowes upon. And yet
though the Lord had cauſe enough againſt him,
yet no cauſe (as I remember) is pleaded, but it
is reſolved into an extraordinary dealing; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God tooke a liberty to glorifie himſelfe, by

enemy himſelfe,</hi> Job 13. 24. None more juſt
then he before: The Lord you know glories in
him: None ever led a ſtricter life, reade the 31.
Chapter; no man kept more in awe, and that by
fearing ſuch a deſertion aforehand; which was
the onely way to prevent it; for what a man
feares, he prayes much againſt: which hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes,
when complaining, he ſayes, Chap. 4.
25. <hi>That though he feared it, yet it came:</hi> Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it was not ordinary, nor indeed is it ſo:
and though <hi>Iob</hi> juſtifies himſelfe too farre, yet
this was it which made him ſo ſtoutly to plead
his owne cauſe, that he could finde no preſident,
no ruled caſe of the like proceeding. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Elihu,</hi> who tooke both Gods part and <hi>Iobs,</hi>
and ſtept up as a moderator, and as one <hi>in Gods
ſtead</hi> to decide the matter, reſolves it moſt of all
into Gods prerogative, though not without
<hi>Iobs</hi> deſert; (yet not ſuch as according to which
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3405:76"/>
God ordinarily proceedeth, not ſo ſeverly
with others;) as appeares by the 34. Chapter:
and to that end he ſet forth Gods greatneſſe, in
the 36. and 37. Chap. And thus God himſelfe
when he came to plead with <hi>Iob</hi> about it, and to
ſhew him a reaſon of it, he onely tells him how
great a God he was, and therefore might doe as
he pleaſed; and uſeth no other arguments in the
38, 39, 40, 41. Chap. God indeed never wants
a cauſe, nor doth deale thus where ſin is not;
yet as it is ſaid of the young man, that he was
blinde, not <hi>for his ſinne, nor his parents</hi> (yet not
without it) <hi>but for the glory of God;</hi> it was an act
of Gods prerogative: ſo here. God had higher
ends of glorifying himſelfe in the patience, and
conqueſt of ſuch a champion as <hi>Iob</hi> was, and of
confuting the devill, who accuſed him of <hi>ſerving
God for nought;</hi> the falſeneſſe of which to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
God tryes concluſions with him; as

That godly men did proſper, and flouriſh out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,

make him amends, as afterward hee did, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring

concealing awhile of his love, as many parents
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3405:76"/>
love to doe by their children, and yet to ſhew it
the more in reall effects, as God even then did,
in making him more then a conquerour.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, before God doth diſpence great
revelations and comforts, hee doth ſometimes
deſert. And as before great diſtreſſes, which he
meanes to leade his children into, hee fills their
hearts with joy unſpeakable and glorious, to

ſtrengthen them againſt the approaching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict:

So on the contrary, ſometimes before great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,

               <p>NOw ſecondly, we come to the more <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
caſes,</hi> wherein God uſually diſpenſeth
light and darkneſſe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A generall rule premiſed. That</hi> God is various in theſe diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Ere I name particulars, I
will premiſe concerning them this generall rule.
Wee ſhall finde, that God goes not conſtantly
by the ſame rule in the diſpenſation of them: ſo
as no man can ſay, that in ſuch and ſuch caſes,
God will and doth certainely deſert men, or
that hee alwayes doth ſo: but is various in his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3405:79"/>
dealings herein. For ſome men hee leaves for a
while in darkneſſe, in, and upon, and immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after their converſion; their ſunne riſeth in an
eclipſe, and continueth ſo till none; yea till their
night: on the contrary, towards others ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he never ſhines in more comforts on them
then at their firſt converſion: againe, ſome hee
deſerts upon a groſſe ſinne committed; to others
he never reveales himſelfe more at any time,
then after a groſſe ſinne humbled for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of; thereby to ſhew the freeneſſe of his
grace. So likewiſe, ſome that have leſſe grace,
and have lived more looſely, he fits their ſailes
at death, and they have <hi>abundant entrance,</hi> with
full ſaile into the <hi>Kingdome of Chriſt;</hi> others
that have walkt more ſtrictly with God, and
whoſe ends you would expect ſhould be moſt
glorious, he leaves to feares, and doubts; and
their Sunne doth ſet in a cloud.</p>
               <p>And the reaſons why God is thus vaious in
theſe his dealings, is both becauſe ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
tend not ſimply <hi>ad eſſe,</hi> but <hi>bene eſſe;</hi> not to
the abſolute being of a Chriſtian, but his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
well-being: and alſo becauſe in reſpect
of their diſpenſation, they are to be reckoned in
the ranke of temporall rewards; and though
light and aſſurance is not an <hi>earthly,</hi> but an <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
bleſſing, yet it is but a <hi>temporary</hi> bleſſing;
and therefore as the promiſes of temporall good
things are not abſolute, no more are the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to give aſſurance to a beleever abſolute, as
to give him heaven and ſalvation are. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3405:79"/>
on the contrary, darkneſſe and diſtreſſe of
conſcience, is but a <hi>temporall</hi> chaſtiſement, as
outward croſſes are; differing from them onely
in the matter of them; the one being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
about things of the outward man; this of
the inward, namely, a mans ſpirituall eſtate.
Hence therefore in the diſpenſation of both,
though God alwayes goes by ſome rule, as in all
other dealings of his; yet ſo as hee varies and
deales differently with his children therein: as
he doth in diſpenſing outward proſperity and
adverſity, <hi>Setting the one againſt the other, to the
end that man ſhould finde nothing after him,</hi> as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
ſayes, Eccleſ. 7. 14. that is, gives ſuch
croſſe and contrary oppoſite inſtances in both
kindes, that men might not <hi>finde him out</hi> in theſe
<hi>wayes,</hi> or <hi>trace</hi> him as the phraſe is, <hi>Rom. 9. ult.</hi>
not ſo, as to ſay certainly, and infallibly, what
he meanes to doe in ſuch and ſuch caſes. Indeed
in the world to come he makes even with all the
world, how differing ſoever his diſpenſations
of rewards or puniſhments have been here; and
what is behinde hand to any one, he then payes
with reſpect to what they have received. Thus
in matter of ſpituall joy and aſſurance God
may vouchſafe it to one that hath not feared
and obeyed him ſo much, as one that walkes in
darkneſſe, but then if any one hath received
more <hi>earneſt pennies</hi> aforehand, and hath not
walkt anſwerably, God conſiders it as an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his ſinne, as he did in <hi>Solomon,</hi> whoſe
ſinne is aggravated by this, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 9, 10.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3405:80"/>
that he ſinned againſt God, who <hi>had appeared to
him twice.</hi> Otherwiſe, if theſe comforts make a
man in any proportion to ſuch coſt, more fruitful
then others are, I ſee not but that God who
crownes his owne graces will reward them the
more; this being one meanes ſanctified to ſome,
to work more grace, as afflictions are to others.
Thus it is in like maner in deſertings, &amp; diſtreſſe
of minde, they being a temporall puniſhment,
God is as various in them. So as one of more
grace, or whom God entends more grace unto,
ſhall be afflicted and forſaken, when one of leſſe
ſhall raigne as a King, as it is ſaid of the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
in caſe of worldly proſperity. So hee
ſhall have peace and liberty of minde, triumph
over Satan and hell,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 9, 10.</note> and diſcomfort; when Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles

or three lyes together, when he fled from <hi>Saul,</hi>
and came to <hi>Ahimelech;</hi> who fearing to harbour
him becauſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> askt him why he was alone;
it being a ſuſpitious thing, that hee ſo great a
man ſhould have no greater traine to attend him:
and did argue that he fled as a proſcribed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and then it would bee dangerous to foſter
him. To this he anſwers roundly; <hi>That the King
had commanded him a buſineſſe.</hi> There is one lie;
and that <hi>the King had commanded him ſecrecy in
it,</hi> there is another: and becauſe <hi>my ſervants</hi>
ſhould not know it, <hi>I have ſent them away</hi> to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
places, there is a third: and againe, at the
8. verſe, <hi>I have not brought my ſword, becauſe the
Kings buſineſſe required haſt,</hi> there is a fourth lie.
<hi>David</hi> went on here in a way of lying; they were
all <hi>made,</hi> and deliberate lyes. Other ſuch like
ſpeeches of his, as that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 8. 10. where
he told <hi>Achiſh, That he went againſt the South of
Iudah, and againſt the South of the Kenites,</hi> v. 10.
when as he went againſt <hi>the Geſhurites and the
Amalekites,</hi> ver. 8. ſome excuſe, becauſe thoſe
nations bordered over <hi>againſt the South of Iudah,</hi>
and <hi>the houſe of the Kenites;</hi> and ſo make a truth
in his ſpeech: but the laſt verſe, that ſayes that
<hi>Achiſh beleeved David,</hi> implyes that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
it, as <hi>David</hi> indeed meant it, as if he went
up againſt his owne countrymen, and then it can
no way be excuſed. Theſe therfore being groſſe
ſinnes, ſinnes againſt light, (as of all ſinnes lying
muſt needs bee ſuppoſed to bee, becauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that truth which riſeth up in the minde)
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3405:83"/>
and is a ſinne wherein a mans minde ſhewes are,
cunning, and wit; and a ſinne, which when the
truth is diſcovered proves exceeding ſhamefull,
and ſcandalous; therefore this ſinne (eſpecially
when it had beene ſome while gone on in by
him, he calls it a <hi>way of lying</hi>) lay heavy on
him long after. Therefore he entreates God to
take the load of it off, <hi>Remove from me the way of
lying;</hi> it was the load hereof which did lye ſo
heavy on him, as it preſſed his ſoule <hi>to the duſt of
death,</hi> as he had before complained.</p>

when we committed it, we had ſhifts to keepe us
from thinking it to be ſinne, or not ſo hainous;
or were doubtfull whether it were a ſinne or no,
and ſo were loath to acknowledge it to be a ſin;
and to burthen our ſelves with it in our confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
but our hearts ſtood out rather to cleare
our ſelves in it: as it is likely <hi>David</hi> did in the caſe
of his murther of <hi>Vriah;</hi> he had done it ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly,
as he thought he could cleare himſelfe
and waſh his hands of it, for it <hi>was but the chance
of war,</hi> (ſayes he,) that did cut him off; <hi>The ſword
devoureth one as well as another;</hi> And ſo he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 25. God in this caſe brings
him to the racke, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. (It is thought that
Pſalme was made, as well as the 51. Pſalme up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that occaſion of his murther; and indeed it
may ſeeme ſo, they are tuned ſo neere together,
as might be ſhewen in many particulars,) Theſe
ſinnes being knowen and become ſcandalous,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3405:83"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> was to confeſſe publiquely; as in the end
he did, when in making the 51. Pſalme. he ſtood
to doe penance in a white ſheete, that I may ſo
ſpeake. Now <hi>David</hi> was loath to come to this,
that murther being done ſo cunningly, he could
hardly be brought to confeſſe it, ſo much as in
ſecret, much leſſe publiquely, God in this caſe
layes his hand ſo ſoarely on him, that his <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
moiſture was dryed up,</hi> as that Pſalme tells us,
(for in men troubled in conſcience, their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of minde caſts their bodies often into as great
heats, as men that are in burning fevers, ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi>
102. 3. in the like fit, he ſayes <hi>his bones were burnt
like an hearth;</hi>) and this was without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>day and night;</hi> and thus he lay <hi>roaring,</hi> ſo hee
expreſſeth his cariage in his torture, like a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
on the rack, though happily he cryed out
for mercy to God, yet becauſe not with a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
heart, God therefore accounted it but as
<hi>roaring,</hi> that is, the voice of a <hi>beaſt</hi> as it were,
rather then the voice of a man humbled for his
ſinne. And why was <hi>David</hi> put to the rack thus?
he would not confeſſe, and humble himſelfe for
his ſinne; <hi>I was ſilent, and yet roared,</hi> ver. 3. a ſtill
broken hearted confeſſion might have ſaved
all this torment. But when in the end <hi>I ſaid
I would confeſſe my ſinne,</hi> ver. 5. and in his
heart he reſolved once to lay open all that ſinne
of murther, and adultery in the circumſtances
of them, then God pardoned him (as you know
he did) for <hi>Nathan</hi> comming to him, told him,
as ſoone as but a word of confeſſion began to fall
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3405:84"/>
from him, <hi>that his ſinnes were pardoned.</hi> And yet
after that, as appeares in the 51. Pſal. God did
not yet <hi>reſtore comfort,</hi> and the <hi>joy of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to him, (for there he prayes for it in the ſenſe
of the want of it) not untill hee had publiquely
confeſt it alſo, and throughly humbled himſelfe,
it having cauſed <hi>the enemies of God to blaſpheme;</hi>
God would have a publique ſatisfaction given.</p>
               <p>So when the inceſtuous perſon had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that ſinne, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 9. for which, as then
hee was not humbled (for afterwards in the
2 Cor. 2. 7. when he was <hi>humbled</hi> indeed, hee
bids them <hi>comfort him</hi>) yet till that his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was apparent, he bids them <hi>to deliver ſuch
an one to Satan,</hi> to the jaylour, to the tormentor
with him, to the prince of darkneſſe to terrifie
him, and afflict his ſpirit. Now the meaning of
that delivering him up to Satan, was that hee
ſhould bee ſolemnly excommunicated, which
when it is performed as it ought to be, <hi>In the
name of the Lord Ieſus,</hi> and with the power of the
Lord Jeſus; then as the Church cuts them off
from communion with them, ſo God from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with himſelf, and withdrawes all felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with their ſpirits, (as was before declared)
And ſo leaves them alone in darkneſſe, and to
deſertions; and not onely ſo, <hi>but delivereth them
up to Satan,</hi> not with a commiſſion to cary them
on to more ſinne (for the end propounded by
the Apoſtle, was thereby to <hi>deſtroy the fleſh,</hi> ver.
5. not to nouriſh it by provoking him to more
ſinne) but to terrifie and afflict his conſcience,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3405:84"/>
and to ſtirre up therein the guilt of ſinne, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
for it. Which God ſanctifies to humble
a man, and to mortifie the fleſh, and thus when
that Corinthian was excommunicated, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up to him, did Satan deale with him; for 2
Cor. 2. 7. he was nigh being <hi>ſwallowed up of too
much ſorow;</hi> and this occaſioned by <hi>Satan, whoſe
devices we are not ignorant of</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle,
ver. 11. Now as every ordinance hath a proper
peculiar worke it is appointed for; an inward ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to accompany it in a mans ſpirit: So this,
and that proper effect, and inward working and
event of this great ordinance of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is terrour, and ſorow, and deſertion of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
thereby to humble a man; even as it is the
proper effect of the Sacraments to convay
comforts and aſſurance, and to convay the <hi>ſeale
of the Spirit.</hi> And when this ordinance is negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
or omitted, when yet groſſe and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ſinnes require it; then a man belonging to
God, God himſelfe often workes thus, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
this on him without that ordinance. Thus
he delt with <hi>David,</hi> and others after groſſe ſins.
God inwadly excommunicates, and caſts men
out of his preſence, and from all comforts in his
ordinances, although they are not refuſed by
men to come to them: dealing herein, as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is a publique magiſtrate, with an unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
childe, after ſome great miſdemeanour,
though he caſt him not off, yet he may ſend him
to the Gaole, to bee for example ſake, impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
for the Gaoler to take him, and to clap
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3405:85"/>
irons on him, to have him downe into the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
where he ſees no light, and into the little
eaſe, where he is in ſo ſtreight a condition, as he
can neither ſit nor ſtand, nor lie, as <hi>Elihu</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
it, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 16. hee calleth it <hi>bringing into a
ſtreight place,</hi> and <hi>binding them in fetters, and
cords of affliction, and then hee ſhewes them their
tranſgreſsion, and wherein they have exceeded.</hi>
ver. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Yea,<note place="margin">And this 3. for ſins long ſince committed.</note> and thirdly, this God doth not onely
preſently after the ſinnes were committed, but
ſometimes a long while after, and that when
they have beene often confeſt. Yea, and after
that God hath pardoned them alſo in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
as well as in heaven; yet the guilt may
returne againe and leave us in darkneſſe. Thus
<hi>Iob</hi> 13. 26. For <hi>the ſinnes of his youth,</hi> (which
queſtionleſſe he had humbled himſelf for, &amp; had
aſſurance of the pardon of, yet) God did <hi>write
bitter things againſt him</hi> for them many yeares
after, and <hi>made him poſſeſſe them,</hi> as himſelfe
ſpeakes. God gave him over to the Gaoler, and
put him into the little eaſe in priſon, <hi>thou putteſt
my feet into the ſtocks,</hi> ſayes he ver. 27. For as
the power of ſinne, and the <hi>law of ſinne</hi> is but in
part done away <hi>in our members,</hi> ſo in <hi>our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
the guilt of ſin</hi> is likewiſe, but in part done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
in regard of our apprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; therefore as thoſe luſts we had thought
dead, and that they would never have riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
doe ſometimes revive and trouble us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh,
comming with new aſſaults; ſo in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3405:85"/>
may the guilt of thoſe ſinnes revive which
we thought long afore had beene pardoned, and
after the commiſſion of ſome new act, or forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of the old, and ſecurity about them,
God may let them looſe upon us afreſh, that we
ſhall looke upon them, as if they never had been
pardoned.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon of all theſe particulars,<note place="margin">The reaſon fo all.</note> both
why groſſe ſinnes, eſpecially if againſt light,
when not confeſſed throughly, ſhould yet after
many yeares caſt us into ſuch fits of deſertion, is</p>
               <p>Becauſe therein we rebell againſt Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and <hi>that</hi> ſpirit, <hi>It a nos tractat, ut à nobis tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatur,</hi>
doth deale with us as wee with him. If
you <hi>grieve him, he grieves you;</hi> if you rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, he fights againſt you as an enemy:
ſo Eſa. 63. 10. <hi>They rebelled, and vexed his holy
Spirit, therefore hee was turned to bee their enemy,
and he fought againſt them;</hi> now to <hi>ſinne againſt
light</hi> is called <hi>rebellion,</hi> ſo <hi>Iob</hi> 24. 11. When
men go about to extinguiſh and darken the <hi>light
of direction,</hi> which God hath ſet up in their
hearts to guide their paths by; God puts out the
<hi>light of comfort,</hi> and ſo leaves them to darkneſſe.
But eſpecially then, when our hearts are ſo full
of guile; as we plead that they are no ſinnes; or
extenuate them, as <hi>David</hi> in all likelihood did.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. in reference to which he ſayes, in 2. <hi>ver.</hi>
of that Pſalme, That <hi>that man is a bleſſed man in
whom is no guile.</hi> and in the 51. Pſal. 6. <hi>Thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt
truth in the inward parts, David</hi> had dealt
guilefully and deceitfully in that ſinne; if man
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3405:86"/>
keepes a ſinne under his tongue, and will not be
convinced of it, nor bring it forth by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
God in that caſe brings him to the rack; as
they doe Traytors to confeſſe: and if it be that
any of our old ſinnes revive, and cauſe theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
it is becauſe wee began to looke on them
as paſt and gone, and thought we needed not go
on to humble our ſelves any more for them; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
account they are ſo buried, as that they
will never riſe againe; when as the remembrance
of them ſhould keep us low, and humble us all
our dayes. It is laid to the charge of them in the
26. of Ezek. 22. <hi>That they remembred not that
they lay in their blood.</hi> We are apt to thinke that
time weares out the guilt of ſinnes: but to God
they are as freſh as if they had beene committed
yeſterday; and therefore nothing weares them
out but repentance. Great ſinnes forgiven muſt
not be forgotten.</p>

of all this, <hi>He went on frowardly in the way of
his heart.</hi> When lighter, and outward ſtrokes
will not take us of, God leaves and deſerts our

for in this caſe what courſe elſe ſhould God
take? for either he muſt give him up to hardneſs
of heart, and leave him to his ſtubbornneſſe, and
ſo he ſhould have loſt his childe; but <hi>that</hi> God

he, ver. 18. When therefore the heart remaines
ſtubborne under other ſtrokes, he hath no way
left in his ordinary courſe and progreſſe, in the
way of meanes, but to lay ſtrokes upon his ſpirit,
and wound <hi>that.</hi> And this yoke is like to break

other outward afflictions mans naturall ſpirit,

Chriſt from death to life:</hi> and wherein lay
principally the demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtration of that power? not
ſimply in raiſing his body up againe; that was no
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3405:88"/>
more then he did to others, but in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 24.
the power is ſaid to be ſhewen in this, that hee
having <hi>loſed the paines of death wherewith it was
impoſsible he ſhould be held, he was raiſed up againe,</hi>
his ſoule was heavy unto death, with terrours:
and thoſe paines in themſelves were <hi>deadly,</hi>
though not to him, in that hee being God as
well as man, it was impoſſible for him to ſinke
under them: now therefore to raiſe up and
glorifie <hi>that</hi> his ſoule that was <hi>ſo</hi> bruiſed,
wounded, and pierced through and through,
herein lay the wonder: and ſuch a wonder
God ſhewed in recovering <hi>Heman.</hi> And to
ſhew the greatneſſe of this worke let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
a little the depth and deadlineſſe of this
kinde of diſtreſſe, it is compared to the <hi>brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of a reede,</hi> which when it is bruiſed, who
can make it ſtand upright againe? It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>The wounding of the ſpirit.</hi> Proverbs 28.
which no creature knowes how to come at
to heale, none but God who is the father
of ſpirits; who made them, and knowes how
to mend them. It is not onely called, the
<hi>ſickneſſe</hi> of the ſpirit, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 33. 24. (where
the want of the aſſurance of the <hi>forgiveneſſe of

to heale, is made the prerogative <hi>of the Sunne of
righteouſneſſe, ariſing with healing in his wings.</hi>
Mal. 4. 2.) but alſo it is called <hi>death and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi>
for ſo in that 88. <hi>Pſalme, Heman</hi> calls
that diſtreſſe that he was in. And the reaſon is,
Gods <hi>favour is our life,</hi> by which wee live and

are more violent, and more powerfull to hold us

make tryall of their hearts. For the ſame ends
as he left <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to the power of ſin, in the

pure, ſincere, and unfained obedience. Then it
is ſeene his repentance is true, when <hi>he repents
not of it,</hi> then, when he is out of hopes of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

But as <hi>Natura vexata prodit ſoipſam;</hi> Nature

them off, as He the viper off his hand: but when
that ſhall begin to be queſtioned (as in this caſe
it is) who is able to ſtand? and what is able to
ſtrengthen a man then, but the power of faith?
as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes of the ſpirit of a man, that it
will beare <hi>all kinde of infirmities,</hi> if it ſelfe bee
whole; but if it be <hi>wounded, who can beare it?</hi> So
I ſay of aſſurance, if it be weakened, and batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>the very foundations thereby are ſhaken;</hi> a mans
freehold toucht; the roote ſtruck; now in ſuch a

ſayes, <hi>Let him truſt, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe it helpes thus
at this dead lift.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Againe, thirdly, in theſe conflicts of faith,
with deſertions, conſiſteth the height of our
Chriſtian warfare. This is the higheſt pitcht
battell, the greateſt, and (as it were) the laſt
brunt, upon which all is either won or loſt; for
in theſe a man encounters with <hi>God</hi> himſelfe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
as an <hi>enemy.</hi> God called out <hi>Iob</hi> to
try him by fighting a ſingle combate with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
and he became (as I may ſo ſay) too hard
for Satan alone; and God joynes againſt him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:
now then, to beare the brunt and ſhock of
his wrath, and yet to ſtand upon a mans feete;
this, to the utmoſt argueth the ſtrength of faith.
Hoſea 12. 3. It is ſaid of <hi>Iacob, That by ſtrength
he had power with God,</hi> it argued ſtrength indeed:
and this is done by faith, by the power whereof
(Gods power rather ſupporting it) a man relies
on <hi>God,</hi> when all his dealings would argue hee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3405:96"/>
had forſaken a man; that though <hi>God</hi> put on ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo angry a countenance, lookes never ſo
ſternely, yet faith is not daſht out of countenance
but can reade love in his angry lookes, and truſt
God beyond what he ſees, it being the <hi>evidence
of things not ſeene.</hi> Then, faith goes wholly out
of it ſelfe, and ſeeing nothing in it ſelfe but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a capacity of mercy, and <hi>plenteous redemption</hi>
which it knowes to <hi>be in God.</hi> This faith is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
of miracles, for it is founded as the earth,
upon meere nothing in it ſelfe, and yet beares the
weight and ſtreſſe of ſinnes, devill, yea of God
himſelfe. And this is the faith ye are converted
by, in <hi>beleeving</hi> then <hi>on him that juſtifies the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi>
Rom. 4. 5. and <hi>that</hi> which we muſt live
by, when all comforts faile: and this is that faith
which muſt ſtand you in ſtead at death, when the
King of feares comes and beſiegeth you: and
this is the faith <hi>that is to honour, and glory at the
appearing of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

encreaſe them, and to eate out corruptions.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. To deſtroy corruption.</note> it is a meanes to <hi>deſtroy the fleſh.</hi> The
inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> was to bee <hi>delivered to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
that is, to be terrified; <hi>to deſtroy the fleſh.</hi> As
corraſives eate out dead fleſh, ſo theſe terrours
the dead corruptions: and the reviving of the
guilt of old ſinnes, doth kill the ſeeds of thoſe
that remaine in the heart. For if an outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
which croſſeth but the ſatisfaction of a

then much more the inward terrour, which the
conſcience feeles, and which ariſeth immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the guilt of a ſinne, muſt needs bee a
meanes much more.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. To humble.</note> it is a meanes to <hi>humble.</hi> So Deut.
8. 16. the end of the biting of the Iſraelites by
Scorpions, (which were the types of theſe ſtings

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. To encreaſe aſſurance in the event.</note> it is a meanes to bring you in more

the bottome, the <hi>dregs thereof, all the wicked of

leave none behinde; but the Vialls of it, which will

This I recall to minde, therefore have I hope. Iob,</hi> though
for a while, at the beginning of the ſtorme he was
ſomewhat calme and quiet in his ſpirit, and it was
his commendation; and therefore in the firſt Chap.
ver. 22. it is ſaid, that <hi>in all this,</hi> that is, ſo long and
thitherto, <hi>he had not charged God fooliſhly;</hi> but this
held but to the firſt and ſecond Chapter, for when
he begunne to bee wet to the ſkin once, and the

then he falls a roaring, Chap. 3. and <hi>Curſeth the day

God in the end ſteps out (as it were) from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
the hangings, over-hearing him, taking him

                  <p>But (good ſoules) you that are in trouble; oh
take heed of ſuch impatient wiſhes or ſpeeches; as
theſe or the like, that all which you have had is but
in hypocriſie; and oh that God would cut me off!
that I were in hell and knew the worſt! take heed
I ſay: When a man is ſicke, and raves, whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
the Phyſitian and thoſe that ſtand about
him would in pitty uſe him gently, they are forced
to hold and binde him; <hi>Impatiens agrotus crudelem
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3405:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
medicum facit,</hi> an impatient patient makes a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
more cruell, then otherwiſe he would bee: So
God would deale more gently with thee, but for
ſuch impatiencies. And know that this is taking
Gods name in vaine in a high degree. You muſt
know that the graces of God written in your hearts
are a part of Gods name, as whereby his love is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
to you; now for you to call the truth of
theſe in queſtion, and ſay they are counterfeit; is
as if you ſhould ſay of the Kings hand and ſeale,
when it comes downe to you, that it were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
and deny it; which is <hi>crimen laſae Majeſtatis.</hi>
So if a ſpeciall friend, or your father had given you
ſome old precious pieces of gold or jewels, &amp;c. as
tokens of their love and remembrances of them,
for you to ſay in a diſtempered fit of jealouſie, all
theſe are but counters &amp; but Alchymie, you ſhould
exceedingly wrong and abuſe their love. Thus is
it if you deny Gods hand-writing in your owne
hearts, when he hath written therein by his Spirit,
joy, feare, love, zeale, &amp;c. and ſhould ſay, It is not
like his hand: So if you deny the ſeale of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
after he hath <hi>ſealed you up unto the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;</hi>
and ſay that all the earneſt-penies of
heaven, are but counters, and alchymie, &amp; nothing
worth; in ſo doing, you <hi>take his name,</hi> his love, his
mercy, and all <hi>in vaine;</hi> yea you <hi>lye againſt the holy
Ghoſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaid in another caſe. Thus
though God give you full leave to try and examine
all his graces in you, and dealings with you; yet
not deſperately at the firſt bluſh and view, upon
the leaſt miſtake or flaw, to ſay they are no graces;
and that hee will never bee mercifull. You abuſe
him when you do ſo: Take heed of it.</p>

which cauſeth thee to feare and thus to call all

                  <p>Theſe are two diſtinct things. For though God
hath juſt cauſe and reaſon to leave us to this
trouble; yet often the thing that troubles and
diſquiets us, is a meere miſtake, a miſapprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
even as a father ſees good reaſon often to
ſcare the childe; but yet the thing he ſuffers him to
be affrighted with, is but a meere bugbeare. It is

                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. What is the true cauſe which provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth God to leave thee to this diſtreſſe.</note> examine what might be the true cauſe that
provokes God thus to leave thee. So <hi>Lament. 3. 40.
Let us ſearch and try our wayes,</hi> it was ſpoken by the
Church in deſertion, as appeares by the former
part of the Chapter. And to helpe your ſelves in
this, goe over all the <hi>Caſes</hi> which have beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded:
haſt thou not been carnally confident
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3405:109"/>
in falſe ſigns? or reſted too much on true, to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of Chriſt, and Gods free grace? Didſt thou not
afore neglect to ſtir up thy own graces? &amp;c. go over
all thoſe caſes mentioned: ſomething or other will
bee found to be the cauſe. This is neceſſary, for all
the cauſe be known, the heart ſubmits not; neither
will it ſanctifie Gods name; nor will the trouble
ceaſe, till that which provokes God to lay it on bee
confeſſed and forſaken. And if it bee a particular
ſinne that God aimes at, then uſually, God uſeth
the horrour for, and the guilt of that very ſinne to
afflict thee with; and then <hi>that</hi> ſin it ſelfe is made
the cauſe of thy trouble in thy owne apprehenſion.
So as then it is eaſily found out; thou wilt finde thy
ſinne to be the thorne in thy foot, the ſtone in thy
ſhoo, that did grate, gal, and vexe thee. <hi>David</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

knew in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. what it was for which God broke
his bones: for his very ſin was it was the iron Mace,
the inſtrumentall cauſe it ſelfe of Gods executing
it upon him; the horrour of that murther God uſed
as the hammer to breake him withall, and as the
rod to whip him with, ver. 3. <hi>My ſinne</hi> (ſayes he)
<hi>is ever before me;</hi> it was ever in his eye. Indeed; in
outward afflictions it is more difficult to finde out
the cauſe why God afflicts a man; (unleſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
you may through Gods wiſe-diſpoſing hand
finde and reade the ſinne in the puniſhment, they
ſo reſemble one another, ſo as a man may ſay, this
croſſe lay in the wombe of ſuch a ſinne, they are ſo
like: <hi>in quo peccamus, in eodem plectimur,</hi>) but in
thoſe inward diſtreſſes of conſcience, that ſin which
is the true cauſe, and that moveth God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
God often uſeth even the guilt of that very
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3405:109"/>
ſinne to terrifie thee; to caſt a man into the diſtreſſe
and to keepe him in it, it is both the procatarticall
cauſe, and executioner alſo.</p>
                  <p>But in caſe thou canſt not finde out the cauſe, as
<hi>Iob</hi> (it ſeemes) did not; and <hi>Elihu</hi> did ſuppoſe hee
might not; therefore gives him this counſell (which
doe thou alſo follow, till God ſhew thee the cauſe)
Job 34. 31, 32. to <hi>ſay unto God</hi> (as hee adviſeth
there) <hi>That which I ſee not, teach thou me, and I will not
offend any more;</hi> and if thou findeſt it, ſay alſo, as ver.
31. <hi>I have borne chaſtiſement</hi> for ſuch a ſinne, <hi>I will
never offend any more:</hi> Till then God will not let
thee downe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing to be ſearched into is;<note place="margin">2. What is the maine reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thy heart, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy eſtate</note> What
is the chiefe and maine reaſoning in thy heart,
which makes thee call all into queſtion, whether
God bee thy God. What is the reaſon why thou
thinkeſt ſo, what makes thee conclude ſo?</p>
                  <p>For this you muſt conſider, that although God
for ſome ſinne committed doth hide himſelfe from
thee, terrifies, and laſheth thy conſcience, yet that
which cauſeth in thee, and worketh in thee this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
[that God hath caſt thee off,] is uſually
ſome falſe reaſoning or miſapprehenſion, ſome
meere miſtake, ſome <hi>deviſe</hi> and ſophiſtry of Satan.
When the <hi>Corinthian</hi> was excommunicated for his
ſinne, Satan had leave to terrifie his conſcience
for it, but Satan went further, he would have <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him up of ſorow,</hi> by perſwading him that ſuch
a ſinne was unpardonable, and that God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
owne him againe: now the reaſoning Satan
uſed to bring this upon him was a falſe one, ſome

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3405:110"/>
eleventh verſe, whereof if a man bee ignorant, hee
may goe mourning a long while, as a caſt-away.
Therefore take thy ſoule aſide, and ſeriouſly aſke
it, and examine it <hi>Why it is thus troubled?</hi> What
reaſon, what ground thou haſt to thinke that God
is not thy God? and then examine it whether it
be a true ground yea, or no? As the Apoſtle bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. whereas he ſpeaks of a wilfull and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

<hi>David</hi> had not beene renewed, for hee ſinned
preſumptuouſly,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 9.</note> and <hi>deſpiſed the commandement.</hi> So
ſome if they heare but of ſome fearefull example,
and of Gods ſevere dealing with others, how hee
caſt them off upon ſuch a ſinne, as he did <hi>Saul,</hi> they
thinke and conclude that upon the commiſſion of

there is no certaine ground for ſuch a thought, for
<hi>ſecret things belong to God.</hi> So becauſe ſome heare
that there is a time, after which, God ſometimes
offers grace no more, but ſweares againſt ſome
men; therefore, that their time is alſo paſt; which
they can have no ground for: for though it bee
true, God doth ſo with many that heare the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
yet the word gives us no certaine rules to
judge he hath done ſo by any of us. It is good to
feare leaſt thou ſhouldſt provoke him to it, but
thou haſt no ſigne to feare hee hath done ſo with
thee. And indeed herein lyes the maine and firſt
buſineſſe to be done in raiſing up a troubled ſoule,
even to finde out the ground of their doubting, and
to examine the truth of it and confute it. If a man
be falſely impriſoned or caſt in a ſuit at Law, what
doth he to remedy it? he ſeekes to finde out the
errour in the writ: ſo doe thou ſearch out the

                  <p>THe third direction I give to ſuch is,<note place="margin">3. To conſider as indifferently what may make for them, as againſt them</note> that they
keepe and lend one eare as well to heare and
conſider what makes for their comfort, as unto
what may make againſt them.</p>
                  <p>This direction meetes with a great infirmity of
ſuch as are in diſtreſſe, who through Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
have their hearts ſo deeply poſſeſſed with
prejudiciall conceits of the miſery of their eſtates,
that as the people of God in Exod. 6. 9. <hi>through the
anguiſh of their hearts</hi> were ſo far diſtempered, that
they <hi>liſtned not</hi> to the good meſſage which <hi>Moſes</hi>
brought them, nor beleeved that ſo good newes
could be true of them: So are the ſoules of many
that are in diſtreſſe, ſo filled with anguiſh and ſenſe
of miſery, and ſo ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
opinions, and ſo farre put out of hopes, that
they reject all that is ſpoken for their comfort; ſo as
they will not ſo much as bee brought to caſt an eye
or a thought upon any thing that may be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of comfort to them: Like ſome priſoners at the
barre, through extremity of feare they cannot read
that in their hearts and in the word which might
ſave them. Tell them of what God hath wrought
for them and in them, as evidences of his love,
and as they cannot, ſo often they will not reade
them over; or if they do they reade them over but
as a man doth a book he meanes to confute, they
picke quarrells, and make objections at every thing
that is ſaid: as if they were hired as Lawyers to
pleade againſt themſelves, and to finde flawes in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3405:112"/>
their evidences. I have obſerved ſome who have
ſet all their wits awork to ſtrengthen all arguments
and objections againſt themſelves, &amp; who have bin
glad if they could object any thing which might
puzzle thoſe who have come to comfort them; if
they could hold argument againſt themſelves: as
if they were diſputing for the victory onely. And
thus through much poring upon, and conſidering
onely what might make againſt them, they have
had the bolts of their hearts ſo farre ſhot into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,
and fixed in deſperate ſorow, and the true
wards of ſound evidences ſo farre wrung and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
by falſe keyes, that when the ſkilfulleſt and
ſtrongeſt comforters have come with true keyes,
to ſhoot back the bolt, they would not turn about,
nay could ſcarce get entrance.</p>
                  <p>This was <hi>Davids</hi> infirmity, as at the 10. verſe
of the 77. Pſalme compared with the ſecond verſe,
<hi>My ſoule refuſeth to be comforted,</hi> he ſpilt all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls
and phyſicke that were brought him: hee
was not onely voide of comfort but refuſed it.
What? bring mee promiſes to comfort me, (will
ſuch an one ſay) you may as well cary them to one
in hell; or give phyſicke to a man paſt recovery;
and ſo will take downe nothing that is given
them. So alſo the Church, in the third of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
ver. 17, 18. her heart was deeply poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
with a deſperate apprehenſion, <hi>My hope</hi> (ſayes
ſhee) <hi>is periſhed from the Lord.</hi> And what was it that
ſhot her ſoule into ſo fixed deſpaire? ver. 17. <hi>Shee
forgot all good:</hi> ſhe forgat, that is, ſhe would not ſo
much as take into conſideration &amp; remembrance,
any thing that had beene comfortable to her. <hi>All
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3405:112"/>
good</hi> (ſo the originall) that is, all Gods former good
and gracious dealings with her, all the good things
wrought in her, and for her, whence ſhee might
have comfort: and inſtead thereof, what did her
thoughts feed and chew upon? onely wormwood
and gall, her bitterneſſe and diſtreſſe, poring onely
on what might make againſt her, <hi>I ſaid my hope was
periſhed from the Lord, calling to minde my affliction,
and my miſery, my wormwood and gall.</hi> Theſe ſhee
could revolve and rowle up and down in her mind
though they were bitter, and would entertaine
thoughts of nothing elſe. But when on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſhee began to take into conſideration, Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
&amp; faithfull ſupporting her in that very deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>in faithfulneſſe renewing his mercies every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
ver. 22, 23. and that ſtill he maintained in her
heart a longing and lingring after him, and a ſecret
cleaving to him, and that God did enable her to
<hi>chooſe</hi> him as her <hi>portion,</hi> ver. 24. <hi>[This] I recall to
minde,</hi> (ſayes ſhee) ver. 21. (which ſpeech hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to thoſe words fore recited, which follow
there;) <hi>therefore have I hope;</hi> ſhe ſpits out her worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
and eares her owne words. And now that
her heart began to liſten to what might comfort
her, preſently ſhe began to have hope. This ſullen
peeviſh deſperate obſtinacy is a thing you ought to
take heed of; for hereby you take Satans part, and
that againſt thoſe you ought to love ſo deerely,
even your owne ſoules: But as they ſaid, <hi>Let Baal

                  <p>THe fourth direction is, to make diligent ſearch

began not onely to bee willing to liſten to what
might make for him, but ſet himſelfe aworke to
recall to minde, to <hi>conſider the dayes of old, to make
diligent ſearch,</hi> namely into the records and regiſter
of Gods dealings, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to ſee if there were never
a record extant which might help him, now the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
pleaded againſt his title: even as if your houſes
and lands were called into queſtion, you would
ſearch over old writings &amp; deeds; ſo do you in this:
<hi>I conſidered</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the ſongs in the night,</hi> (that is)
that joyfull communion he had enjoyed with God
when God and he ſang ſongs together, and <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:3405:113"/>
I toſſed and tumbled over my heart, to ſee if no
grace formerly had beene there, and if no grace at
preſent were there; he ſearched into what might
comfort him, as well as into the cauſes might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
God thus to deale with him, for I take it both
may be meant.</p>
                  <p>And ſo <hi>Iob</hi> did, when he was thus ſtricken, and
forſaken of God, he viewes over every part of his
life; he ſeekes what dry land he could finde to get
footing upon in the midſt of ſeas of temptations,
recounts what an holy life he had lived, with what
feare and ſtrictneſſe he had ſerved God. Chap. 29.
and Chap. 30. and Chap. 31. throughout, and tells
them plainely, Chap. 27. ver. 5, 6. That let them
pleade and argue what they could againſt him, and
goe about to prove him an hypocrite, till <hi>I die</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>I will not remove mine integrity from mee,
nor let goe my righteouſneſſe:</hi> I will never give up
mine intereſt in Gods mercies, nor the evidences I
have to ſhew for them, and ſayes he Chap. 19. 27, 28.
<hi>Though my reines be at preſent conſumed, yet the root of
the matter is in me;</hi> (that is) though God deales thus
hardly with me, as you ſee, yea though the exerciſe
of grace is much obſcured, the Sun-ſhine of Gods

the joyfull fruits of righteouſneſſe, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                        </gap>;</hi>
a root of faith that decayes not, a conſtant frame
of grace, that ſtill remaines, which hareth ſinne,
loveth God, and you ſhall all never beare me from
it. And canſt thou call nothing to remembrance
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3405:114"/>
betwixt God and thee, which argues infallibly his
love? what nothing? Looke againe, Did God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſpeake peace to thy heart, and ſhed his love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in it? Haſt thou at no time found in thine
heart pure ſtraines of true love and good will to
him? ſome pure drops of godly ſorow for offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, and found ſome diſpoſitions of pure
ſelfe-deniall, wherein thou didſt ſimply ayme at

never an olde tryed evidence which hath beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged

now call to minde but one, if in truth, it may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

then all doe: for every one conveyes whole <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
in <hi>whom all the promiſes are made,</hi> and who is the

whole Chriſt. And if thou canſt ſay as the Church
of Epheſus, <hi>Rev. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

grace, and though they had many ſinnes and many
failings, yet (ſayes he) <hi>this thou haſt, &amp;c.</hi> If Chriſt
will acknowledge thee to be his for one eare-mark;
or if he ſees but one <hi>ſpot of his child</hi> upon thee,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 5.</note> thou
maiſt well pleade it, even any one to him; Yea
though it be but in a leſſer degree, if in truth and
ſincerity. For God brings not a paire of ſcales to
weigh your graces, and if they be too light refuſeth
them; but he brings a touchſtone to try them; and
if they be true gold, though never ſo little of it, it
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3405:114"/>
will paſſe currant with him; though it be but <hi>ſmoak</hi>

it is there in the originall, likelier to dye &amp; go out
then to continue, which we uſe to throw away; yet
he will not <hi>quench</hi> it, but accept it. Yea and though
at preſent thou findeſt in thy ſenſe no grace ſtirring
in thee, nothing but hardneſſe, deadneſſe, &amp;c. yet
if thou canſt remember, [yea but <hi>this</hi> once <hi>I had;]</hi> as
a woman with childe, though after her firſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
ſhe doth not alwayes finde the childe to ſtir,
yet becauſe ſhe did feele it ſtir, ſhe ſtill conceives
hopes and thinkes ſhee is with childe; So thinke
thou of the new creature formed within thee.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things you are to recall and conſider in
time of diſtreſſe: to remember former graces, and
ſpirituall diſpoſitions in you, and Gods gracious
dealings with you; God remembers them to have
mercy on you; and why ſhould not you remember
them to comfort you? Therefore Heb. 6. 9, 10.
<hi>We hope</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>better things of you, for God is not
unrighteous to forget your labour of love,</hi> namely, to
reward you; and therefore hee calls upon them in
like maner, Heb. 10. ver. 31. <hi>To call to remembrance
the former dayes</hi> to comfort them; how they held
out when their hearts were tryed to the bottome;
when ſhipwrack was made of their goods, good

finde no comfort at firſt from them, (as often yee

not to be neglected, and is found often comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
therefore in the former direction I exhorted to
it: yet you are not onely to take that courſe, nor
to look back, ſo much to your former faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
as to forget to practiſe new. But begin to

practiſe new acts of faith and repentance, this is
the righteſt way, the ſhorteſt cut, and requires as

will require many termes to examine over all thy
evidences againe and againe, which alſo haply are
blotted and blurred; thou maiſt cut the knot and
diſſolve the temptations ſooner by new faith, then
untie it by reaſonings and diſputings: And the
truth is, in the end thou muſt come to this, for Gods

your faith &amp; repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance: <hi>Except ye he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verted,</hi> (as
Chriſt ſayes to his Apoſtles) Converted as it were
anew. He will not deliver thee out of the dungeon,
till thou entreſt into new bonds and baile for thy
good behaviour. Therfore begin to do it ſoon. And
whereas thou thinkſt that by this thou maiſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
thy former title, that is not my meaning, as if
thou ſhouldſt utterly give up thy old faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
as counterfeit; <hi>I will keep my integrity</hi> (ſayes
<hi>Iob:</hi>) only my advice is to forbeare, and to ceaſe
pleading of it for a time, and to begin to renew it
rather, that is it I exhort unto: And then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of thy old repentance will come in: As the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſayes of the Law, ſo I of thy former title, <hi>it
is not deſtroyed,</hi> but <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> rather by this. And as
Chriſt ſayes <hi>Iohn 7. 17. If any man will do his will, he
ſhall know of the doctrine that it is of God:</hi> So as often
the beſt <hi>way to know the truth</hi> is not to ſpend all the
time in diſputing about it, but to practiſe it, which
puts an end to controverſies in mens hearts: ſo ſay
I, to know the truth of, and ſo to come to have the
comfort of former grace, is to adde to theſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3405:117"/>
about it, the practice of beleeving and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
anew: This baffles the devill exceedingly,
and gets the advantage of him: for by this the
ſuite is removed, all his old pleas daſht, this puts
him upon a new reply, diverts the war, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
non-pluſſeth him, for what can he ſay to it?
he muſt now prove thou art uncapable of grace,
that thou ſhalt never repent, which all the world
and devills in hell cannot prove. And yet if in this
caſe he tells thee (as uſually he doth) that all will
be in vaine for time to come, as well as it hath been
for time paſt:</p>

thou findeſt no relliſh in the ordinances, yet uſe

of it: Say, be I damned or ſaved, hypocrite or not
hypocrite, I reſolve to goe on. And there is good
reaſon for it: for if thou ſhouldeſt leave off to

it, onely as it is a direction, and meanes
of ſupport and comfort in this diſtreſſe; and ſo take
it as it riſeth out of the text. Thus,</p>
                  <p>That to one who reſolves to feare God and obey him,
the Name of God is an al ſufficient prop and ſtay for his
faith to reſt on <hi>when he ſees nothing in himſelfe, or
in any promiſe in the word belonging unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Name of God</hi> alone is here oppoſed to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes and props which faith hath to reſt on.
It is oppoſed to all comfortable ſenſe of Gods love,
to all ſight of any grace in a mans ſelfe to which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
promiſe is made: So that when the ſoule ſhall
looke into its ſelfe with one eye, and glaunce over
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3405:119"/>
all the word of God with another; and yet ſhall ſee
not any one grace in the one, nor promiſe in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made to any grace in it ſelfe which it may reſt
upon; yet the ſoule then looking upon God, and
conſidering <hi>what a God he is,</hi> and what he ſayes of
himſelfe, of his <hi>mercy and kindneſſe,</hi> and <hi>free grace</hi>
towards ſinfull men. The conſideration of what
meerely it knowes to be in God as he is revealed in
the covenant of grace, may ſupport him. This it is
to ſtay upon his name.</p>
                  <p>Now to explaine this further to you: By the
name of God two things are meant.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thoſe <hi>glorious attributes,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>grace</hi>
and <hi>mercy,</hi> whereby God hath expreſſed himſelfe,
and made himſelfe knowne to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt, as hee is made and ſet
forth to be righteouſneſſe to the ſons of men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the firſt, in the 24. of Exod. ver. 4, 5, 6, 7.
The Lord proclaimed his name;</hi> The Lord God,
mercifull, gracious, long-ſuffering, aboundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving
iniquity, tranſgreſsion, and ſinne, <hi>and</hi> will by no meanes
cleare the impenitent.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond, I referre to that place, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 6.
ſpeaking of Chriſt; <hi>This is the name wherewith hee
ſhall be called,</hi> or made knowne to us; THE LORD
OUR RIGHTEOUSNESSE, (that is,) that Jeſus
Chriſt who is God, hath righteouſneſſe in him for
us, which may be made ours.</p>
                  <p>So that when a poore ſoule in diſtreſſe is not able
to ſay, I ſee ſuch or ſuch ſignes, or any evidence
in my ſelfe, whereby I can ſay God is my God, or
that Chriſt is mine; yet becauſe I ſee free grace
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3405:119"/>
enough in God, and righteouſneſſe in Chriſt,
which I being a ſinfull man, and not a devill,
may therefore bee capable of, and may come
to have an intereſt in them, though I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in my ſelfe whereby I can challenge any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
intereſt: and becauſe <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> is his
<hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Our Righteouſneſſe</hi> his Sonnes <hi>Name;</hi>
therefore I doe caſt my ſelfe upon both, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and favour, and thereupon my ſoule leanes,
ſtaies, and abides, and from theſe it will not bee
driven. So that theſe two apprehenſions meeting
in the heart in truth, help to make up this reſting
upon his Name here ſpoken of; namely, Firſt, [that
there is ſuch free grace, good will, and mercy, &amp;c.
in God, and that Jeſus Chriſt is appointed and
made to be our Righteouſnes.] And ſecondly, [that
I am capable of, and may come to have an intereſt
in both theſe,] and that though there be nothing
in me which may challenge an intereſt in them, yet
there is nothing that excludes mee; whereupon I
caſt my ſelfe upon God for both, and there reſt:
yea though I cannot yet ſay that ever I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them. And this where it is in truth, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with that firme reſolution of turning
to God in all things aforementioned, is as good
faith as any of you have in your hearts.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I come to the proofe of this: namely,
That when the name of God and Chriſt are thus
ſimply and alone apprehended, they may bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground for faith to reſt upon; then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more comfortable to a poore diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
beleever. <hi>Num.</hi> 14. When Gods wrath waxed
hot againſt his people, (as ſometimes in like
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3405:120"/>
maner it doth againſt a poore ſoule) that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſay, <hi>how long ſhall they provoke me? ver.</hi> 11.
and ſpeakes of deſtroying them, and of making
<hi>Moſes</hi> a great Nation: what hath <hi>Moſes</hi> his faith
recourſe unto, but to that proclamation of his
Name you heard of before? and urgeth that, <hi>ver.
17, 18. Let the power of my Lord bee great according
as thou haſt ſpoken: The Lord is long ſuffering, and of
great mercy, forgiving iniquitie, tranſgreſsion, and ſin,</hi>
and he deſires him to ſhew his power in pardoning,
becauſe as much power is ſeen in overcomming his
wrath, as in making a world. <hi>Let thy power be great;</hi>
it was his name you ſee that was alledged by <hi>Moſes</hi>
and prevailed with God for mercy. So alſo for his
Sonnes ſake, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſſe, Elihu</hi> ſayes
Job 33. when a mans ſoule is in deepeſt diſtreſſe, as
in the 19, 20, 21, 22. ver. he deſcribes it, yet ſayes
he ver. 23. <hi>If there be a meſſenger to ſhew a man his
uprightneſſe,</hi> that is, that <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is laid
up for men <hi>in the Lord Ieſus: then God is gracious to
him,</hi> and ſayes, <hi>deliver him,</hi> and he reſting thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>his fleſh returnes to him againe;</hi> it is a meanes to
ſtay him and reſtore him. I mention theſe places
of the olde Teſtament rather then of the new; out
of which you ſee Gods name and his Sonnes name
are al-ſufficient to uphold and ſupport a ſoule. So
the pen-man of that Pſalme, whether <hi>David</hi> or
whoever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. when hee was <hi>in his depths,</hi> as

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3405:120"/>
no more; <hi>in him,</hi> and <hi>with him,</hi> it is to be had: and
he confirmes his faith in that, by this argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
elſe <hi>none would feare him:</hi> and <hi>If thou wert ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
to marke what were amiſſe, no man could ſtand,</hi>
or would be ſaved: therefore <hi>ſurely</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

ver.</hi> 7. And why? what, becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſees he hath

elſe he will have none, and Iſrael is mentioned in

waite and hope in the Lord. ver.</hi> 5. and though hee
could not ſay that God had forgiven him, yet <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe
was with him:</hi> and there hee pitcheth and
reſteth his ſoule; as a beggar at a great mans doore,
when there is none elſe in the country able or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to relieve him, there he lyes; though hee
knowes not whether he ſhall have any thing or no.
<hi>In my fathers houſe there is bread enough,</hi> (ſayes the

and there is <hi>enough;</hi> and <hi>crummes</hi> will <hi>ſerve me,</hi> ſayes

ſuch faith among all my diſciples. Theſe truſted in

ver. 8. 9. And what was it he reſted upon? ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
two attributes of his, viz. <hi>Mercy and Power. God

hath ſpoken once,</hi> (that is, irrevocably: as <hi>Pſal. 89. 35.

<hi>this,</hi> that is, often met with it in the word, and

ſo as he is able to ſave in the greateſt diſtreſſe; and I
have heard that <hi>to him belongeth mercy alſo, v.</hi> 12. &amp;
therefore he may bee willing to help, and becauſe
theſe are in him, though I have nothing in my ſelf,

                  <p>Therefore now, when you relye upon his Name
having as yet no promiſe made to any thing in you
to relye upon, you then relye upon that which is
the foundation of all thoſe promiſes, you then have

to doe any thing for us, muſt needs be (when

but an act of faith further ſtretched out. As an
Allegory is but a continued Metaphor, ſo waiting
is but a continuing to beleeve on God, and to look
for help from him, with ſubmiſſion, though hee
ſtayes long ere he comes. Waiting is an act of
faith reſting on God; and an act of hope expecting
help from him; an act of patience, the minde qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
contenting it ſelfe till God doth come, and of
ſubmiſſion if he ſhould not come. Therefore ſayes
the Church being in this very caſe: <hi>It is good</hi> (ſayes

                     <hi>and quietly to waite for the ſalvation of

afflict the leſſe, caſe you the ſooner, comfort you
the more when he doth come; and in the meane
while it makes you to <hi>poſſeſſe your ſoules,</hi> and to bee
your ſelves, and upholds them: and to doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
to be impatient, and to <hi>give over looking for
the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Abaz</hi> did, is the greateſt folly that can

he keepes the keyes of the dungeon, and you muſt

you, for he is a God of judgement,</hi> a wiſe and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
God, and knowes the fitteſt times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and that he ſtayes ſo long, is not out of want
of mercy, <hi>for he waits,</hi> and longs <hi>to be gracious;</hi> but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3405:125"/>
he doth it out of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> and his wiſdome ſees
not a fit time; he is grieved as well as you, that you
are not yet fit for mercy, that his mercy would not
yet be exalted if he ſhould ſhew it, till you further
ſee your miſery; and therefore ſayes he, <hi>Bleſſed are
all they that waite for him.</hi> And as he now waiteth
but to be the more gracious to thee, ſo he did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
a long while waite for thee, that thou
ſhouldeſt begin to turne to him, and ſaid, <hi>When will
it once be; Ier. 13. ult.</hi> Thou madeſt him ſtay thy
leiſure in turning from thy ſinne, why may he not
make thee ſtay his for the pardon of it? And indeed
the eſcaping hell in the end is ſo great a mercy,
that it is worth the waiting for all thy daies, though
thou endure an hell here, and getteſt not a good
looke till the very laſt gaſpe and moment of living;
therefore <hi>put thy mouth in the duſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lament. 3 29.</note> 
                     <hi>and waite quietly,
if there may be hope</hi> at laſt.</p>
                  <p>And waiting thus, goe on to <hi>uſe all the meanes of
grace more diligently,</hi> more conſtantly, though
thou findeſt a long while no good by them: omit
no ordinance God hath appointed for thy comfort
and recovery: As in a long ſickneſſe, you ſtill uſe
meanes though many have failed, as the woman
who had the bloody iſſue, <hi>ſpent all upon Phyſitians,</hi> in
the uſe of meanes for her recovery. <hi>That</hi> trouble
of minde doth onely hurt you, that drives you
from the meanes: <hi>that</hi> trouble of minde that
drives you to the meanes can never hurt you.
Therefore the devill endeavours nothing more
then to keep ſuch ſoules from the word, from good
company, from the Sacraments, from prayer, by
objecting their unprofitablenes unto them, &amp; that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3405:126"/>
all is in vaine, and that you doe but increaſe your
condemnation.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, if thou learneſt no other leſſon in the
uſe of the meanes, but that thou art of thy ſelf moſt
unprofitable; and that unleſſe <hi>God teacheth thee to
profit,</hi> no good is done, and ſo learneſt to depend
upon God in the ordinance; This is a great degree
of profiting.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, as when men are ſick and eate, and
caſt up againe, you uſe to ſay, yet take ſomething
downe, for ſome ſtrength is gotten, ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
in the ſtomack which keepes life and ſoule
together: So I ſay here, though thou ſhouldeſt
forget in a maner all thou heareſt, ſeemeſt to reape
no benefit by it: yet heare, for ſome ſecret ſtrength
is gotten by it. And for encreaſing thy condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
know, that utterly to neglect and deſpiſe the
meanes is greater condemnation: and know that if
thou ſhouldſt uſe them in a way of dependance, &amp;
obedience to God, it would leſſen thy condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore reade, pray, meditate, heare, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,
receive the Sacraments, forbeare not theſe
your appointed meales. Indeed when the body is
ſick ye uſe to forbeare your appointed foode, but
when the ſoule is ſick there is more need of them
then ever. All theſe are both meate and medicine,
foode, phyſick, cordials, and all. Uſe reading the
word; <hi>The Scriptures were written for our conſolation,</hi>
therefore reade them much: attend on preaching,
for God <hi>creates the fruits of the lippes peace,</hi> Iſa. 57.
So receive the Sacrament often, thoſe dayes are
ſealing dayes; goe thou and confeſſe thy ſinnes,
write over thy pardon, put in all thou knoweſt by
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3405:126"/>
thy ſelfe, bring it to Chriſt to ſet his ſeale to it.</p>
                  <p>Onely take this caution, that thou truſt not to
the uſe of the meanes, but unto God in the meanes:
To think, oh I ſhall have comfort by ſuch a man, or
at ſuch a time, in ſuch an ordinance; this often da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
all. So beleeve in God as if you uſed no means,
and yet as diligently uſe the meanes, even as if
your confidence were to be in them.</p>

                  <p>And if light and mercy yet comes not, but ſtill
God ſeemes as it were to caſt thee off; then call to

                     <note place="margin">Hoſea 2. 19.</note> produce it at ſuch a time as this. And
if thou ſhouldeſt diſcerne no grace in thee thy ſelf,
yet deſire him to look into thy heart; &amp; be bold to

himſelfe wrote, never to be blotted out, if there be
not ſome ſpark of love to him, and his feare, which
himſelfe put there; and aſke him if hee knowes his

thou canſt not reade it, (thy graces being much
blurred) yet hee can reade his owne hand at any
time, and will not deny it.</p>
                  <p>Thou maiſt be yet bolder. Yea deſire him to
look into his own heart, and therein to view the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi>
he had of thee, &amp; thoſe ſecret ancient thoughts
he bore towards thee, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all eternity. And if at firſt

and if he hath not knowne and taken thee for his

of his hands, and table of his heart, with ſuch deep
and laſting letters of loving kindneſſe, as are not as

(Tell him) thou dareſt referre thy ſelfe wholly to

what paſt between him and his Sonne concerning

Chriſt as thy ſurety and a witneſſe thereof for thee,
who was privy to all his counſell, whether thou art
not one of thoſe he gave unto him with a charge to
redeem and ſave. And deſire him to look into <hi>Chriſts
heart</hi> alſo, if thy name bee not written there with
his own hand; and if that Chriſt did not beare thy
name written up in his heart (as the high Prieſt did
the names of all the Tribes,) when he hung upon
the Croſſe, and when he aſcended into the Holy of
holies. Thus <hi>Habakkuk</hi> putting up a prayer in the
name of the Church, hath taught us to plead, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.
12. Oh Lord, <hi>Art not thou from everlaſting my God,
and mine holy One?</hi> It was a bold queſtion, yet God
diſlikes it not, but approves it, and preſently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to it in a gracious anſwer to their hearts ere
they went any further: for their next words, and
thoſe abruptly ſpoken, by reaſon of a ſuddain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
are an aſſurance of this, <hi>Wee ſhall not die.</hi> God
being put thus to it, and his own thoughts being
ſpoken, could not deny it; he acknowledgeth it was
true. And thus whileſt thou maiſt bee a ſpeaking
blindfold as it were, caſting anchor in the dark, yet

and fall upon thy neck and kiſſe thee.</p>
                  <p>And if yet after continuall praying thus, thou

prayer. And if prayer will doe no good, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,

when thou canſt not ſpeake; groane, ſigh, ſob,

                  <p>See what himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Ier. 31. 18, 19, 20. Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im

and lookt ſternly on him, as if he had meant

and to challenge him and his eternall love, <hi>Thou art

This I ground upon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 17, 18. What
was the true iſſue of that his trouble there, whom
God contended with? It was <hi>healing</hi> and <hi>guiding. I
will guide him,</hi> and <hi>I will heale him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You that are troubled in minde, thinke not your
eſtates to bee good, ſimply becauſe you begin to
ceaſe to be troubled, but onely then when the iſſue
of your trouble is healing your ſpirits, by ſome
ſound ground of comfort; and when guidance in
Gods wayes, and more cloſe walking with God is
the iſſue of it. For God may ſlack the cords and
take you off the rack, when yet hee hath not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
you. A traitour who was caſt into the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
and had many irons on him, may be let out
of the dungeon, and have his irons taken off, and
have the liberty of the Tower, and walke abroad
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3405:133"/>
againe, with his keeper with him, and yet not have
his pardon: nay uſually before execution they
uſe to take their irons off, and let them have more
freedome. Thus it is with many. I thanke God
(ſayes one) I have had much trouble of minde, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
of conſcience, ſuch and ſuch ſinnes terrified
me, and I could not ſleep for them: but now I am
well again, and now they do not trouble me. Yea,
but is this all? Thou haſt cauſe to feare that thy
irons are but taken off againſt execution. It is with
men in point of trouble of minde in the guilt of
ſinne, as in the power of it; in juſtification, as in
ſanctification: A man who hath had a ſtrong luſt
ſtirring in him, if he hath gone a yeare or two, and
findeth it not to ſtirre, he therefore thinkes hee is
utterly freed from it, which yet may be but a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi>
of it, not killing of it; a <hi>ceſſation,</hi> not <hi>mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi>
So it is often in this trouble of minde,
which ariſeth from the guilt of ſinne, becauſe a
man findes not thoſe doubts, and feares, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in his heart which he had wont, therefore
preſently he thinkes all is well: when as it may be
but meerly a <hi>truce,</hi> not a <hi>peace;</hi> a laying downe of
armes onely for a while, to make greater prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the ſoule afterwards; a reprivall and
a little enlargement in priſon, not a pardon, if this
be all the iſſue of it.</p>
                  <p>That you may further conceive the meaning of
this, in one that is Gods child, and in a wicked man
(though both may be, and are troubled in minde
and conſcience, yet) there is a maine difference,
both in the maine <hi>cauſe</hi> of their trouble, and alſo
in the iſſue and removall of their trouble. A wicked
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3405:134"/>
mans trouble is for the anguiſh and preſent ſmart
he feeles in ſinne, and in Gods wrath laſhing his
conſcience, and out of feares that his ſinne will not
be pardoned, but that he ſhal endure theſe tortures
for ever in hell: So it was in <hi>Iudas, Cain,</hi> and many
others: but a godly mans trouble (though it hath
often all this in it, yet the chiefeſt of his trouble is
a further thing) it is not onely the ſmart, the ſting
of ſinne; but alſo the filth, the fowlneſſe, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it done to God, that wounds him: for he
hath an <hi>heart after Gods heart,</hi> and therefore lookes
on ſin with the ſame kinde of eye that God doth;
and as God accounts the offence done to him the
greateſt evill in ſinne, ſo doth a godly heart alſo.
It is not the ſting of this ſerpent only, but the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it that diſquiets him; neither is it onely the
want of pardon of ſinne, and the feare of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
wrath which mainly troubleth him, but
the want of Gods favour, the parting with him,
whom he ſees ſo excellent and glorious; the want
of ſeeing his face, his deſire is to live in his ſight,
and to have God to be his God. Now ſuch as the
wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is, ſuch alſo is the remedy. Therfore the one
being but troubled with the ſting, the ſmart of ſin;
pull but that ſting out, take that loade off, and he is
well enough, as jocund, as pleaſant as ever: it being
preſent eaſe that he ſeekes, and to that end confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
his ſinne, and doth any thing for the preſent
to come out of it; As <hi>Pharaoh, Exod. 10. 17. Take
away this death onely:</hi> or at the utmoſt, his aime is
but pardon of ſinne, and peace with God, that hee
may be freed from the feares of undergoing that
for ever, the earneſt whereof he feeles in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3405:134"/>
now. And hence therfore the remedies they
often have recourſe unto are ſuitable; they are but
like rattles to ſtill childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with: they run to merry
company, and to muſick, &amp;c. as <hi>Cain</hi> fell <hi>a building
Cities;</hi> and ſo they put off the terrours of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.
It is eaſe they ſeeke and no more: or they
runne to a formall performance of duties: even as
poore ſoules under Popery, when they were ſtung
by the Friars Sermons, they ſet them penances and
good deeds to be done, which ſtilled them awhile,
&amp; for them they thought they ſhould have pardon:
So men run now to holy duties, but with the ſame
opinion that they did then, as bribes for a pardon,
<hi>what ſhall I give</hi> (ſayes he in <hi>Micah) for the ſinne of
my ſoule?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Micah 6. 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now the wound of Gods childe being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
not the ſting of ſinne onely, but the poiſon of
it; not the ſmart, but the offence done to God; nor
the feare of his wrath, but want of his favour: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
accordingly eaſe from thoſe terrours pacifie
not him; no not ſimply peace with God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
him, or a pardon. He ſayes not onely, <hi>Oh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this
death onely;</hi> but, <hi>who ſhall deliver me from this body of
death.</hi> If newes were brought him that God would
pardon him, and not call him to reckoning for any
ſinne, and no more were ſpoken to his conſcience,
he would ſtill be troubled, till hee had aſſurance of
his good will alſo: if it were ſaid, God will indeed
pardon thee, but he will never love thee as hee did,
he will not looke on thee, thou muſt not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his ſight: This would grieve the ſoule more
then the other would content it, and he would be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3405:135"/>
everlaſtingly troubled. I may allude to that which
<hi>Abſolom</hi> ſaid in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plement of his Father, when he
was baniſhed from him, to expreſſe the true deſire
&amp; greateſt trouble of a ſoul in this caſe, as you have
it 2 <hi>Sam. 14. 32. Abſolom</hi> was pardoned the fault,
but it contented him not: <hi>Let mee ſee his face, or let
him kill me:</hi> So it is with a poore ſoule; eaſe, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
knocking off his bolts content him not, till he
enjoyes communion with God, till he ſees his face
in his ordinances: Pſal. 24. 6. <hi>This is the generation
of them that ſeek him, that ſeek thy face.</hi> (that is) this is
the marke, the <hi>genius,</hi> the diſpoſition of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
This you may ſee in <hi>David,</hi> when his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
was wounded for that great ſinne; what was
it troubled him? Not the want of pardon of ſin,
for the Prophet told him God had pardoned him;
not the meere ſtings of conſcience, and ach of his
broken bones, <hi>but that againſt thee, thee, have I ſinned,</hi>
ſo as eaſe could not ſatisfie him; but further ver.
10. <hi>Create in me a cleane ſpirit,</hi> which hee ſpeakes
becauſe he having chewed the cud of that unclean
act, it had left a ſoile in his fancy: <hi>and renew a right
ſpirit within me;</hi> oh give me grace and <hi>truth of heart</hi>
to thee, and oh let mee live in thy preſence, and ſee
thee, and have acquaintance with thee, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. the
want of this was it that troubled him, which till he
had obtained, he could never be at quiet: for hee
ſought not eaſe, or pardon onely, but healing of his
conſcience by the favour of God, and his love ſhed
abroad. So as take heed of reſting in eaſe, (as if your
hearts be right you will not, you will waite till the
<hi>Sunne of righteouſneſſe ariſe with healing in his wings,</hi>)<note place="margin">Mal. 4. 2.</note>
Are you now in darkneſſe, full of terrours and Gods
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3405:135"/>
wrath? you will not reſt till that darkneſſe be
diſpelled by the ariſing of the light of the Sun
of righteouſneſſe on you, and revealing Gods
face in the face of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> till his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
be conveyed to your hearts by ſome of
his wings, by ſome promiſe, by ſome ordinance

of ſin, nothing but <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſnes will heal
it: the wound being the want of Gods favour,
and of the evidence of his being your God, the
want of his face and good will, nothing but the
revealing and ariſing of this in your hearts will
heale you: for looke what the wound is, ſuch is
the plaiſter: and indeed this onely heales; for
though by other meanes the ſore may be skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
over, and eaſe gotten; yet it will break <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the joy of thy ſalvation,</hi> ſayes <hi>David, that the bones
that thou haſt broken may rejoyce:</hi> and how heals
he him? <hi>I create of the fruit of the lips, peace.</hi>
Hee doth it by ſome promiſe or other: if the
want of the ſenſe of communion with God, and
abſence from him diſquiets a man, then the
heart reſts not till it hath found its <hi>Welbeloved,
Cant.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If doubts that no grace is
in the heart, then the heart reſts not till ſome
grace in truth be evidenced, and ſome ſuch
promiſe made to ſome grace brought home:
ſtill look what the trouble is, ſuch alſo muſt the

before: to this purpoſe you muſt remember, that

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, fire,</hi> you know, was it they offered their

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> when they offered Incenſe or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
acceptable to God, they were not to offer it
with <hi>common fire,</hi> which is ordinary in the world
in their chimneys and kitchings, which was
kindled by themſelves by ſparkes out of ſtones,
or from things here below; but it was to be <hi>fire
from heaven,</hi> and taken <hi>from the Altar.</hi> So <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.
24. which was kept continually burning, and
therefore when a new Altar was made, <hi>fire came
from heaven, 2 Kings.</hi> 7. 3. and the <hi>high prieſt</hi> was
to <hi>take fire off the Altar,</hi> when ever hee offered
Incenſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 12. And therefore when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi>
and <hi>Abibu</hi> offered <hi>common fire</hi> of <hi>their owne
kindling, Lev.</hi> 10. 1. they were conſumed, for
thinking to pleaſe God with it: Now all theſe
things fell out in types to them. For anſwerably
by <hi>fire of their owne kindling,</hi> is meant the <hi>common
righteouſneſſe</hi> of <hi>Civility,</hi> and naturall devotion,
which was <hi>by nature</hi> in ſome of the heathen, <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 14. found even in their chimneys: which alſo
the <hi>Iewes</hi> performed, both by the common help
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3405:143"/>
of nature, cuſtome, and education, by the ſtrength
of naturall principles, of conſcience enlightned
by the law, &amp; ſelf-love emproved; all which thus
comming, but from nature not renewed by
grace, is ſaid to be of their <hi>owne kindling:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
yet they thought to pleaſe God, and reſted
in it, as a ſacrifice well pleaſing to him; as <hi>Nadab</hi>

their hearts, and making them new creatures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
them into the ſame <hi>Image</hi> of holineſſe
which was in him; which as it addes to what is

much from that <hi>goodneſſe of nature</hi> you bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, or which hath been wrought in
you by education, as the fire and light of the <hi>Sun</hi>

            <p>Now becauſe the <hi>Iewes</hi> reſted in ſuch an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

which is the <hi>fire from heaven,</hi> and the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

the Word, <hi>did not our hearts burn within us?</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:3405:145"/>
(ſay they) ſo it heats the heart in prayer, makes
a man <hi>fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. What incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives enflame it.</note> examine what bellowes cheriſh and
keep alive that fire of righteouſneſſe that is in
thee, and makes it flame, (that is) what motives
ſet thee awork, to doe what thou doſt: if world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ends make thee abſtaine from ſinne, and to be
juſt in thy dealings, as credit with the world,
and feare of diſgrace, or the accuſings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
onely, or feare of hell, or hope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
this is but common fire: but if love to God,
the conſideration of his mercies, his eternall
love, and the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> zeale for his glory,
if theſe be the bellowes, the fire is heavenly. But
if when thou art to be moved with ſuch as theſe,
they ſtir not thy heart, <hi>It is but common fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Vſe is,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> to take heed of walking
in the light of ſuch fire, that is, reſting in it for
ſalvation, and contenting your ſelves with it, as
moſt in the world doe, and as the <hi>Iews</hi> here did,
for you will lie down in ſorrow if you doe.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, wee doe not truſt in this our
owne righteouſneſſe, for we profeſſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
beleeve in him, which added to this, is enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer.</hi> That though you profeſſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
yet<hi rend="sup">1</hi>. unleſſe you have had a light that hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to you, that all the righteouſneſſe you
have by nature, and emproved in nature is a
falſe righteouſneſſe, you doe then as yet reſt in
your owne righteouſneſſe, and rely not wholly
on <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>Phil. 3. Paul firſt ſum</hi> all to be droſſe
and dung, <hi>counted it loſſe, that he might which r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:3405:145"/>
it implies, he could not have him els. Men though
they ſeem to take <hi>Chriſts</hi> Title, as many will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Kings Title for a living to make all ſure,
yet they keep, and ſtick to, and plead their own;
but you muſt give up that firſt, and rely wholly
on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or hee will not ſave you.</p>
               <p>2. Hee that doth not daily above all things,
directly, and immediately aime at, and ſeek out
for <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſneſſe, and maketh it not the
chiefeſt of his thoughts, prayers, and buſineſſe, &amp;
is reſtleſſe without it, reſts in his owne: for ſo
when he had given up his title in his owne, hee
mainely endeavoured after this, <hi>to bee found in
Chriſt. Phil.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> you will ſeeke from <hi>Chriſt</hi> a new
righteouſneſſe of ſanctification alſo: for you will
ſee that the common righteouſneſſe of nature
and education will not pleaſe him, and <hi>Chriſt</hi>
muſt be made <hi>ſanctification</hi> to you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30.
aſwell as <hi>righteouſneſſe.</hi> Thus <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> though
a civill man afore, yet when he came to <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
his old civility would not ſerve, without being
borne againe, and becomming a new creature:
ſo as you muſt not think to make a ſupply or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> with fire of your owne kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
you muſt have all off the <hi>Altar:</hi> your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vertues muſt be turned into graces, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a new end put into them, carrying your
hearts in them unto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The other interpretation</hi> which I adde,<note place="margin">2. By fire is meant outward comforts.</note> is, That
<hi>the fire of outward comforts</hi> is alſo meant: which,
whilſt men enjoy, they goe on merrily, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3405:146"/>
God, and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and communion with him:
But the ſoule of a beleever wanting this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God, is in darkneſſe, and till he enjoys
God againe, can take comfort in nothing. Thus
<hi>Eccl. 7. 6. The laughter of the wicked</hi> is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to <hi>the crackling of thornes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fire</hi> is a comfortable creature,<note place="margin">Why <hi>fire</hi> is put for <hi>comfort.</hi>

               <p>Heat <hi>is comfortable. Therefore</hi> Iſa. 44. 16.
Hee warmeth himſelfe (<hi>ſaith the Prophet</hi>) and

               <p>Light <hi>alſo is comfortable. For ſaith</hi> Solomon,
It is a pleaſant thing to behold the Sunne. <hi>Hence

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>fuell</hi> of theſe fires of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe when this fuell is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the fire goes out, ſo doe mens hearts die
when outward things are taken from them.
When <hi>Nabal</hi> thought <hi>David</hi> might yet come,

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> fire is a <hi>devouring</hi> thing; a whole

                  <hi>Fiſtly,</hi> the <hi>pleaſures</hi> which ariſe from the

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>So that put theſe together, both <hi>that ſtrange
fire</hi> of their own righteouſneſſe, which is from,
and in nature, unchanged; and the <hi>kitching fire</hi> of
outward comforts: theſe are the two maine hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances
that keepe all wicked men from <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
and <hi>juſtification</hi> through him:</p>
               <p>That whereas the convenant of grace hath
theſe two maine promiſes in it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> that <hi>God himſelf</hi> (who is the <hi>God of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>)
will be an <hi>abundant reward, Gen.</hi> 17. 1, 2.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3405:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſo by faith we take him to be, and are divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
from all comforts elſe in compariſon of
him. And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> his Sonne is made
the <hi>Lord our righteouſneſſe, Ier.</hi> 23. 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ere we take him to be ſo to us, we muſt be
emptied of all our <hi>owne righteouſneſſe by nature,</hi>
that ſo <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>Chriſt</hi> might <hi>be all in all to us.</hi> And
therefore as <hi>the firſt</hi> &amp; main work of grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
both in emptying the heart, and bringing it
to <hi>nothing</hi> in <hi>its owne righteouſneſſe:</hi> As alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of all <hi>outward comforts,</hi> that ſo <hi>no fleſh might
rejoyce in his ſight.</hi> Anſwerably unto theſe
two there are found two maine impediments in
men by nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe in nature, they find ſome ſparks
of civill goodneſſe, they reſt in them, and take
them for grace, and neglect <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> finding alſo in this world themſelves
to be warmed with many outward comforts,
being encompaſſed about with ſparks, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themſelves with theſe. Thus ſo long as that
young man had righteouſneſſe of his owne, and
poſſeſſions of his owne, he cared not for <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
nor communion with him, nor righteouſneſſe
from him. Well, but (ſayes <hi>Chriſt</hi> here) flatter
your ſelves with your own righteouſneſſe, and
cheer your ſelves with your <hi>own ſparks,</hi> and <hi>walk
on.</hi> But know <hi>you will lie down in ſorrow</hi> when the
<hi>godly ſhall reſt in their beds. Iſa.</hi> 57. 2. You will lie
bed-rid in hell; or as a <hi>woman in travaile</hi> never
to riſe again.</p>
